The record \n sales of the prior year therefore could not be repeated. However, Schaffner is purposefully in-\n vesting in the development of new high-margin growth segments, thus creating the basis \n for future growth.\n \n The Schaffner Group in fiscal 2018/19 booked new orders of CHF 200.7 million (2017/18: CHF 223.5 million). Net sales were  \n 197.4 million (prior year/PY: CHF 221.5 million), a decrease of 10.9%, or 9.3% in local currencies. The Group’s book-to-bill ratio in \n the fiscal year was 1.02 (PY: 1.01). The sales reduction involved all divisions, with Automotive seeing the largest decrease. The sales de-\n cline had two main causes: the significantly lower momentum of important end markets as a result of the trade tensions between the \n USA and China, and the expiration of projects in the Automotive division. The exchange rate situation was also a downside factor. Schaff-\n ner immediately responded to these developments with additional cost reduction measures, but continues to invest judiciously in the \n future.\n \n The gross margin was 27.9% (PY: 28.4%). Operating profit (EBIT) decreased to CHF 9.8 million (PY: CHF 17.2 million), due mainly \n to the reduction in the Automotive business and generally lower utilization at most production plants. The resulting EBIT margin in \n the fiscal year was 5.0% (PY: 7.7%). The comparable EBIT margin in the prior year was 7.2%, i.e., excluding that year’s combined net \n positive one-time effect of CHF 1.2 million from insurance payments after the fire at the plant in Thailand in late 2017 and costs for the \n restructuring  of  the  Power  Magnetics  division.  Net  profit  for  the  period  decreased  by  CHF  2.2  million,  to  CHF  7.2  million  \n (PY: CHF 9.4 million). Excluding the prior year’s one-off negative CHF 2.7 million impact of the US tax reform (US Tax Cuts and \n Jobs Act), the decrease would have been CHF 4.9 million. Earnings per share came to CHF 11.36 (PY: CHF 14.81). Free cash flow im-\n proved significantly to CHF 6.3 million (PY: CHF 0.5 million). As a result of the capacity adjustments to match the new market con-\n ditions, the worldwide employee headcount decreased by 403 individuals to 2,422.\n \n Schaffner continued to invest about 8% of sales in research and development, with the central focus in the year being placed on the ad-\n vancement of the comprehensive portfolio featuring EMC filters, particularly for applications in new market and customer segments. \n Schaffner also drove forward the development of EMC filters for the specific requirements of electromobility and launched the latest \n generation of antennas for vehicle keyless authentication systems. The first significant orders at the beginning of the new fiscal year demon-\n strate the opportunities for success offered by these new product platforms.\n \n Business is broad-based\n The Schaffner Group’s businesses continue to be supported by a broad geographic base. Europe’s share of Group sales in the fiscal \n year grew slightly to 47% (PY: 45%). The decreased sales share of the Asia region, at 32% (PY: 35%), reflected especially the slow-\n ing market growth in China. The Americas contributed 21% of sales (PY: 20%). In terms of its end markets as well, the Schaffner \n Group is broadly diversified. The market for energy-efficient drive systems, at 23% in the year (PY: 23%), again generated the larg-\n est portion of the Group’s revenue. Despite the weakness in the automobile industry, automotive electronics once again was the \n second largest sales sector, at 19% (PY: 22%). The sales share earned with products for power supplies of electronic devices was 15% \n (PY: 14%). Rail technology made up 13% (PY: 13%), and the machine tools and robotics sector also brought in a steady 13%  \n (PY: 13%) of the Schaffner Group’s sales.\n \n \f \n \n         Urs Kaufmann, Chairman of the Board of Directors  \n \n               Marc Aeschlimann, Chief Executive Officer\n \n EMC division\n The EMC division, the leader in the global market for EMC filters, operating in an increasingly demanding environment especially \n in the second half of the year, generated new orders of CHF 104.3 million in fiscal 2018/19 (PY: CHF 116.7 million). Its net sales \n were CHF 106.9 million (PY: CHF 115.9 million). The book-to-bill ratio was 0.98 (PY: 1.01). The EMC division had segment profit \n (EBIT) of CHF 15.2 million (PY: CHF 17.8 million) and its EBIT margin remained attractive at 14.2% (PY: 15.3%). The share \n provided by the EMC division’s Power Quality business unit grew somewhat in the year under review. \n \n Power Magnetics division\n The Power Magnetics division, which completed its restructuring in fiscal 2018/19, recorded net sales of CHF 52.0 million in \n the year (PY: CHF 56.6 million). The segment loss (EBIT) was halved to CHF 3.3 million (PY: CHF 6.8 million). With new \n orders of CHF 56.9 million (PY: CHF 57.8 million), the book-to-bill ratio was 1.09.\n \n Automotive division\n Given the sharp downturn in the global automotive market at the end of 2018, combined with the expiration of projects, net sales \n of the Automotive division in fiscal 2018/19 contracted significantly from the prior year to CHF 38.5 million (PY: CHF 49.0 mil-\n lion). Segment profit (EBIT) fell markedly to CHF 2.6 million (PY including one-time effects: CHF 11.3 million); the EBIT mar-\n gin declined to 6.6% (PY: 23.1%). With new orders of CHF 39.4 million (PY: CHF 49.0 million), the book-to-bill ratio in the re-\n porting period was 1.02 (PY: 1.0).\n \n Strengthened balance sheet\n The Schaffner Group’s financing structure remains sound. At the year-end reporting date of 30 September 2019, total assets showed \n a decrease to CHF 141.9 million (PY: CHF 148.5 million). The Group was able to reduce net working capital to CHF 38.3 mil-\n lion (PY: CHF 44.1 million). Net debt fell to CHF 15.7 million (PY: CHF 19.1 million). Shareholders’ equity was up slightly at \n the balance sheet date to CHF 63.2 million (PY: CHF 59.0 million), making for an increase in Schaffner’s equity ratio to 44.5% \n (PY: 39.7%). Equity per share amounted to CHF 99.42 (PY: CHF 92.80).\n \n Risk management\n At its meeting on 3 May 2019 the Board of Directors, as part of ongoing risk management, assessed the business risks of the Schaff-\n ner Group and adopted the risk report and the measures set out in it. The subjects of focus in the year were cyber security, warranty \n risks, the dependence on the global economic situation, and currency risks.\n \n Distribution proposal to shareholders\n Schaffner Holding AG pursues an earnings-based dividend policy. In setting the amount of the distribution, the Board is guided \n by a target range of 40% to 50% of net profit. For fiscal year 2018/19 the Board will propose to shareholders at the Annual Gen-\n eral Meeting on 14 January 2020 to make a distribution of CHF 5.00 per share (PY: CHF 6.50), which represents 44% (PY: 44%) \n \n \fTo our shareholders\n \n 8\n \n of the Group’s net profit. Per share entitled to dividends, the planned distribution consists of an ordinary dividend of CHF 2.50 \n from retained earnings and a distribution (exempt from Swiss anticipatory tax) of CHF 2.50 from the distributable share premium \n reserve.\n \n Changes on the Board of Directors and Executive Committee\n Suzanne Thoma will step down from the Board of Directors of Schaffner Holding AG at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on \n 14 January 2020. The Board thanks Suzanne Thoma warmly for the valuable and close collaboration over the years and wishes her \n all the best for the future. At the AGM, the Board will propose that shareholders re-elect the remaining four members of the Board \n for the term ending at the conclusion of the next AGM. \n \n On 1 November 2018, Martin Lütenegger assumed the leadership of the Automotive division, and since 19 November 2018,  \n Daniel G. Zeidler is in charge of the Power Magnetics division. As well, on 1 April 2019, Christian Herren became the Group's \n new CFO, succeeding Kurt Ledermann, who had held the position for ten years.\n \n Outlook\n Owing to the continuing subdued sentiment in world markets, Schaffner expects the business environment in 2019/20 to still remain \n demanding. However, the strategic projects are progressing to plan and Schaffner is resolutely investing in new products and markets \n that will have a positive impact on business in the medium term. Schaffner is thus strengthening the foundation for future growth. Pos-\n itive impetus in the first quarter of the new fiscal year was provided by the new major orders from various well-known car manufactur-\n ers. The latest-generation antennas for keyless authentication systems should positively affect earnings from fiscal 2020/21. In the cur-\n rent new fiscal year, the Automotive division expects a still challenging situation, as the short-term project pipeline heralds a subdued \n trajectory. Schaffner chooses not to issue quantified guidance for fiscal year 2019/20, against the backdrop of the high volatility and \n limited visibility in the Group’s markets. For the medium term, however (assuming macroeconomic and currency stability), Schaff-\n ner’s targets are unchanged at organic sales growth averaging about 5% per year and an EBIT margin in the range of 8% to  \n 10%.\n \n Thank you\n A big thank-you goes to Schaffner’s employees. Their technical excellence, creativity and strong commitment have been indis-\n pensable to all parts of the Group. We thank our customers for their valued partnership and their high confidence in our solu-\n tions. The Board of Directors and Executive Committee also sincerely thank the loyal shareholders of the Schaffner Group. By \n their steadfast support, they give Schaffner added stability and are integral to the Group’s sustained success. \n \n Urs Kaufmann \n Chairman of the Board \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n Marc Aeschlimann\n Chief Executive Officer\n \n \fDivisions (operating segments)\n \n 9\n \n Divisions\n \n Schaffner made focused investments in the development of  \n new business segments \n \n Schaffner expects continuing worldwide growth in the use of electronic systems and in \n demand for electric energy.

Other applications are power \n supplies for electronic devices (such as in medical technology), rapid charging systems for electric vehicles, and the growing mar-\n ket for LED lamps.\n \n \fDivisions (operating segments)\n \n 10\n \n In fiscal 2018/19 the EMC division acquitted itself well in an \n economic environment that, especially in the second half of the \n year, became more demanding. With sales of CHF 106.9 mil-\n lion (PY: CHF 115.9 million), the division accounted for 54% \n (PY: 52%) of the Schaffner Group’s sales. The decrease of 7.7% \n (or 5.8% in local-currency terms) from the prior year’s record \n result was due mainly to restrained investment in key markets. \n The strain in world markets also led to a slight revenue decline \n in the Power Quality business unit, which is integrated in the \n EMC  division.  The  division’s  new  orders  in  the  fiscal  year \n amounted to CHF 104.3 million (PY: CHF 116.7 million), \n with a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98 (PY: 1.01). As visibility in the \n EMC division’s end markets should remain low for the time be-\n ing, Schaffner is projecting continuing sluggish demand for the \n first half of 2019/20 in particular.\n \n Underpinned by a continuing very good gross margin, the EMC \n division earned a segment profit (EBIT) of CHF 15.2 million \n (PY: CHF 17.8 million), with the EBIT margin remaining at \n an attractive 14.2% (PY: 15.3%).\n \n Reacting to the growing global uncertainty over the economic \n trend, many distributors reduced their inventory levels, notably \n in the latter half of fiscal 2018/19, despite partly stable demand \n from their end customers. While this inventory drawdown am-\n plified the revenue reduction in the reporting period, upon an \n improvement in the investment climate it should have a positive \n impact on new orders for the EMC division.\n \n Besides the ongoing further development of the existing prod-\n ucts and solutions, in 2018/19 the EMC division invested heav-\n ily in EMC filter applications for new market and customer seg-\n ments. For instance, additional growth potential is found in new \n products for the rapidly growing market of smart grids. Excit-\n ing application opportunities are also created by new filter solu-\n tions for the power supplies of LED lighting. The focused in-\n vestment in these new, promising applications continues to be \n pursued despite the current demanding market environment.\n \n IEC inlet filter (power entry module) for use in medical devices and other  \n applications\n \n Current-compensated choke for LED lighting, building services and other uses\n \n Financials\n in CHF m, except %\n Order intake\n Segment sales\n Segment EBIT\n Segment EBIT margin\n \n 2018 / 19\n 104.3\n 106.9\n 15.2\n 14.2%\n \n 2017/18\n 116.7\n 115.9\n 17.8\n 15.3%\n \n Change \n –10.5%\n –7.7%\n –14.6%\n –\n \n \fDivisions (operating segments)\n \n 11\n \n Power Magnetics division\n \n Loss cut in half\n The Power Magnetics division develops and manufactures components to ensure the reliable operation of power electronic systems, \n and builds customized transformers. Schaffner’s solutions safeguard high levels of energy conversion efficiency and assure optimum \n adaptation of the systems to electricity grids. The main sales markets include rail technology, energy-efficient drive systems, energy \n supply, and renewable energy sources, such as wind power.\n \n The Power Magnetics division, which completed its restructur-\n ing in fiscal 2018/19, recorded net sales of CHF 52.0 million \n in the year (PY: CHF 56.6 million). As in the prior year, it thus \n generated 26% of the Schaffner Group’s sales. The segment loss \n (EBIT) was halved in the reporting period to CHF 3.3 million \n (PY: CHF 6.8 million), corresponding to an EBIT margin of \n –6.4% (PY: -12.0%). The unsatisfactory divisional result is ex-\n plained in part by high warranty costs for products supplied in \n the past, and insufficient utilization in some plants. In the year \n under review, new orders of CHF 56.9 million (PY: CHF 57.8 \n million) surpassed net sales by almost CHF 5 million, for a \n book-to-bill ratio of 1.09.\n \n Financials\n in CHF m, except %\n Order intake\n Segment sales\n Segment EBIT\n Segment EBIT margin\n \n 201 8/ 19\n 56.9\n 52.0\n –3.3\n –6.4%\n \n 2017/18\n 57.8\n 56.6\n –6.8\n –12.0%\n \n Change \n –1.5%\n –8.2%\n 51.5%\n –\n \n \fDivisions (operating segments)\n \n 12\n \n While demand in the Americas was very good during the whole \n fiscal year, Europe and particularly Asia saw a slight pullback in \n the second half of the year. The foremost reason for this was a \n temporary  delay  in  the  production  of  high-speed  trains  in \n China. In Europe, customers postponed two significant projects. \n Given the continuing narrow customer base, these deferrals \n could  not  be  made  up  for  with  other  orders.  In  fiscal  year \n 2018/19, except in the USA, these developments translated into \n underutilization of the manufacturing plants and a correspond-\n ing negative impact on margins.\n \n In rail technology, Schaffner is the leading provider of power \n electronic systems for the power supply of electrical systems in \n rail vehicles. In the year, this position was further cemented \n through collaboration with a specialized contract manufacturer \n in India on selected projects. \n \n The Power Magnetics division has started the new fiscal year \n 2019/20 with a sustained good order situation in the Americas. \n In China, demand will stabilize beginning in the second quar-\n ter of 2019/20 with the rising production of a new generation \n of trains that have a top speed of 250 kilometers per hour. This \n and the demand in the Americas should both be positive for the \n division's results, even as order volume remains unsatisfactory in \n Europe. \n \n Common-mode and differential-mode inductor for medium-voltage  \n applications, such as in rail technology \n \n Compact medium-frequency transformer for use in building services,  \n among other applications\n \n \fDivisions (operating segments)\n \n 13\n \n Automotive division\n \n New orders strengthen medium-term outlook – fiscal 2019/20 still strained\n The Automotive division is one of the world’s top two suppliers of antennas for vehicle keyless authentication systems. With its special-\n ized EMC expertise, it also supports leading automobile manufacturers and system vendors in the development and manufacturing of \n filter solutions for hybrid and electric vehicles. \n \n The global automotive market cooled abruptly since the end of \n 2018. The significant decline in demand for new vehicles forced \n automakers to streamline their product ranges and reduce the \n number of units built. For some model series, production was \n even discontinued early. In the Automotive division in fiscal year \n 2018/19 this led to a significant sales reduction to CHF 38.5 \n million (PY: CHF 49.0 million). As a result, the division’s share \n of the Schaffner Group’s sales eased from 22% to 20%.\n \n Financials\n in CHF m, except %\n Order intake\n Segment sales\n Segment EBIT\n Segment EBIT margin\n \n 2018 / 19\n 39.4\n 38.5\n 2.6\n 6.6%\n \n 2017/18\n 49.0\n 49.0\n 11.3\n 23.1%\n \n Change\n –19.6%\n –21.4%\n –77.4%\n –\n \n \fDivisions (operating segments)\n \n 14\n \n Segment EBIT fell markedly to CHF 2.6 million (PY: CHF \n 11.3 million); the EBIT margin declined to 6.6% (PY: 23.1%). \n Excluding the prior year’s positive one-time effect from insur-\n ance benefits after the industrial fire in Thailand, segment EBIT \n fell by CHF 6.3 million.The decrease was driven primarily by \n the underutilization in antenna production as a result of the sig-\n nificantly reduced unit volume. It was also partly due to the fact \n that higher-margin markets and products were disproportion-\n ately affected by the weakness in demand. With new orders of \n CHF 39.4 million (PY: CHF 49.0 million), the book-to-bill ra-\n tio in fiscal 2018/19 was 1.02 (PY: 1.0).\n \n Notwithstanding the market situation, in the fiscal year the Au-\n tomotive division invested substantially in new products and \n solutions. Thus, strides were made in the development of new \n filter solutions for use in hybrid and electric vehicles, and new \n longer-range antennas for keyless authentication systems were \n taken to market readiness. This groundwork already bore divi-\n dends: At the beginning of the new, 2019/20 fiscal year, Schaff-\n ner received large multi-year orders from several big-name car \n manufacturers, mainly for the latest generation of antennas for \n use in new model platforms. Once the production lines are in \n place, the new orders, in step with the market launch of the new \n vehicles, will make a growing contribution to the division’s re-\n sults from fiscal 2020/21. A positive impact, after a phase-in pe-\n riod, will also come from the new plant in Thailand, which is \n equipped with cutting-edge manufacturing technology and will \n commence operation incrementally in early 2020.\n \n Thanks to the major orders won at the start of the new fiscal year \n for antennas for keyless authentication systems, the Automotive \n division has a well-filled order pipeline in the medium term. In \n the short run, however, the situation for the Automotive divi-\n sion continues to be challenging, as demand in 2019/20 is ex-\n pected to remain subdued.\n \n Schaffner is well-positioned in solutions for the international \n automobile industry and is a partner in various projects of im-\n portant companies for the development of electric powertrains \n to be used in high-volume model series. In the medium term in \n the Automotive division, Schaffner is thus aiming for growth \n above the Group average, with an EBIT margin in the low  \n double-digit percentage range.\n \n High-voltage DC filter for reducing electromagnetic interference noise and \n meeting automotive standards in electric vehicles\n \n Interior antenna for use in keyless authentication systems for vehicles\n \n \fSustainability\n \n 2018\n 19\n \n \fSustainability\n \n 16\n \n Sustainability matters\n \n Sustainable  practices  are  a  high  priority  for  the  Schaffner  Group.  Its  corporate  culture  is \n marked by a holistic approach, based on honesty, respect, fairness and a sense of social res-\n ponsibility as a global company. With innovative spirit and engineering excellence, Schaffner \n supports the efficient and reliable use of electrical energy. Systematic quality and environ-\n mental management ensure that international standards are met or exceeded.\n \n As an active member of the UN Global Compact, the corporate sustainability initiative that has been joined by more than 9,900 \n companies from over 160 countries, Schaffner is committed to honoring the ten principles of the Compact, which address human \n rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. These principles form an integral part of all employment contracts. Schaffner \n expects its employees to be accountable for their actions, to treat people, society and the environment respectfully and to act with \n integrity. Schaffner’s manufacturing and logistics centers apply an environmental management system that meets the international \n ISO 14001 standard. The operating facilities also fulfil the requirements of ISO 45001. This new international standard for health \n and safety management systems allows the systematic improvement of workplace safety and serves the enhanced protection of em-\n ployees’ health. The latest relevant report (Communication on Progress) of Schaffner Holding AG is available at:\n www.unglobalcompact.org/participation/report/cop/create-and-submit/active/428053\n \n In addition, the Schaffner Group has adopted the Code of Conduct of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the leading in-\n dustry coalition of its kind. This Code is a set of social, environmental and ethical industry standards for implementing sustaina-\n ble processes in supply chains. Schaffner is committed to ensuring safe working conditions, respectful and dignified treatment of \n employees and sustainable manufacturing processes in the entire value chain. The RBA Code of Conduct can be viewed at:\n www.responsiblebusiness.org/standards/code-of-conduct\n \n Schaffner also supports the Conflict Minerals Act for the protection of human rights in the mining industry, particularly in the ex-\n traction of ore to produce tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold in conflict regions. More information can be found at:\n www.business-humanrights.org/en/conflict-peace/conflict-minerals\n \n Commitment of the Executive Committee\n The Executive Committee of the Schaffner Group actively supports the efforts to improve sustainability. The relevant key perfor-\n mance indicators are reported periodically to the Executive Committee. It discusses the results and takes corresponding action as \n part of a continuous process of improvement.\n \n Social performance\n People make the difference: In its role as an employer, the Group pursues a socially responsible and progressive personnel pol-\n icy. Schaffner promotes the diversity of employees in its international organization and supports them in the intercultural col-\n laboration at work. With production centers on three continents, cross-cultural cooperation is practiced as a day-to-day real-\n ity at Schaffner. At the Swiss headquarters in Luterbach alone, people from eighteen different nations work together and bring \n their unique perspectives to the work process. Language courses in German and English foster employee integration and fa-\n cilitate cohesive work across international borders. \n \n \fSustainability\n \n 17\n \n Schaffner is also engaged in furthering cooperation between generations and brings together employees of all age groups. Young \n learners with their high digital affinity introduce new perspectives in this collaboration, while older colleagues are able to share \n their comprehensive knowledge and experience.\n \n As a forward-looking and fair employer, Schaffner supports the compatibility of career and family life with family-friendly \n working conditions. Schaffner accommodates the social trend of a changing division of responsibilities within the family \n through programs for female and male employees, including offering paternity leave and flexible part-time schedules. This en-\n ables fathers to participate equally in family care.\n \n The values initiative launched in fiscal year 2017/18 to strengthen the corporate culture was continued in 2018/19, further \n entrenching the Schaffner Values throughout the Group. The five fundamental values – leadership, ownership, customer fo-\n cus, openness, and passion – apply worldwide, but are to be practiced in diverse forms according to the local cultures. To help \n achieve this, local ambassadors initiate specific activities that focus on local challenges and needs in concrete ways. A keynote \n event in the year under review was the meeting of Schaffner’s global senior management, which was dedicated to the topic of \n leadership culture. Training activities that built on this and were spread over the year further reinforced the establishment of \n the fundamental values in the entire group. Shared standards provide guidance for managers and create the basis for transfer-\n ring responsibility to employees and promoting their greater autonomy – empowerment that boosts performance. \n \n With the move to the company’s new office building at the headquarters in Luterbach, the office concept was transformed. \n The new, ample workspace built to an open-plan design strengthens collaboration, encourages communication and allows easy \n interaction between staff. In addition, Schaffner offers new forms of workplace arrangements, such as home office and co-work-\n ing. This addresses employees' changing requirements for the work environment, while also helping to improve sustainability \n by relieving strain on regional transportation infrastructure.\n \n In the new head office building in Luterbach, abundant light and transparency of design ensure a pleasant work atmosphere\n \n \fSustainability\n \n 18\n \n Work-related lost time  \n accident rate  \n (LTA/250,000)1\n \n 1\n \n 0.75\n \n 0.5\n \n 0.25\n \n 0\n \n 7\n 1\n /\n 6\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 8\n 1\n /\n 7\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 9\n 1\n /\n 8\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 1 For the fiscal year from October to \n September.\n \n Schaffner conscientiously promotes employee health and workplace safety. Regular compli-\n ance checks are carried out at the Group sites. The results are analyzed and, as part of the con-\n tinual advancement of workplace safety and employee health, the findings are used in setting \n the health and safety objectives both for the Group and the individual sites. Schaffner main-\n tains an occupational health management system, for which a focus topic is chosen each year. \n Against the backdrop of the move to the new office building at the Luterbach headquarters, \n the focal theme in 2019 was ergonomics in the workplace. Employees’ awareness of good er-\n gonomics was raised in workshops and they were involved in the procurement of the office \n furniture. The health program also includes an in-house sports offering, as well as regular “ap-\n ple weeks” to encourage a healthy diet.\n \n Schaffner pursues active employee development, and expects employees to engage in their per-\n sonal development and do their part to keep pace with the Group’s dynamic evolution. In turn, \n the Group is committed to supporting employees in their professional growth. Amid the dig-\n ital transformation of business, the need to ensure continued employability is gaining in im-\n portance. Individual training and development goals are set together with the employees, who \n are supported with funding and/or time in reaching these objectives.\n \n Schaffner employees receive a significant share of the \n value generated by the Group. In fiscal year 2018/19, \n Schaffner’s value generation amounted to CHF 80 mil-\n lion. Of this total, 83% was directly or indirectly paid \n to employees, and 1% went to the public sector in the \n form of corporate income tax. Five percent is available \n for distribution to shareholders (subject to their ap-\n proval  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting)  and  6%  re-\n mained in the company as depreciation, amortization \n and retained earnings. \n \n Sharing of value generated in 2018/19\n \n 4% \n Schaffner Group \n (retained earnings)\n \n 6% \n Schaffner Group \n (depreciation, \n amortization)\n \n 5% \n Shareholders  \n (proposed dividend) \n \n 1% \n Public sector  \n (corporate income tax)\n \n 1% \n Creditors  \n (interest on capital)\n \n 83% \n Employees  \n (staff costs)\n \n CHF 80 m\n \n (value created in  \n fiscal 2018/19)\n \n Energy consumption\n KWh per CHF ’000 of sales1\n \n 80\n \n 60\n \n 40\n \n 20\n \n 0\n \n 1 July to June.\n \n 7\n 1\n /\n 6\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 8\n 1\n /\n 7\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 9\n 1\n /\n 8\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n Environmental performance \n Schaffner is progressively making the operating business in its whole value chain more effective and \n efficient. A particular focus of these efforts is on reducing energy consumption in and CO2 emissions \n from its business activities. In this way, Schaffner contributes to the reduction of climate-harming \n greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, the Schaffner Group’s energy costs represent less than 1% of its \n sales. \n \n In the development of new products, the use of materials and processes responsible for the produc-\n tion of greenhouse gases is avoided to the extent possible. For example, in the EMC and Automotive \n divisions, filters were marked with labels instead of ink, thus reducing the use of solvents to a mini-\n mum. The Schaffner Group’s transformer plant in the USA offers customers the capability to rewind \n old transformers on the existing structure and thus extend their service life. The old copper is collected \n and recycled.\n \n \fSustainability\n \n 19\n \n With the relocation to new buildings at two sites, Schaffner also further lowered its CO2 emissions: In Luterbach, the staff moved into \n the new head office premises as planned at the end of August 2019. The new building is heated primarily with groundwater. The geo-\n thermal probes required for this can also be used to cool the technical facilities as needed. Some of the electricity for the operation of \n the building is supplied by an efficient solar power system. A further reduction in CO2 emissions will be made possible by the newly con-\n structed manufacturing building previously damaged by fire in December 2017 at the plant in Lamphun, Thailand.\n \n CO2 emissions from production\n Kg per CHF ’000 of sales1\n \n CO2 emissions from transport\n Kg per CHF ’000 of sales1\n \n Water consumption\n L per CHF ’000 of sales1\n \n Waste generation\n Kg per CHF ’000 of sales1\n \n 80\n \n 60\n \n 40\n \n 20\n \n 0\n \n 7\n 1\n /\n 6\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 8\n 1\n /\n 7\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 9\n 1\n /\n 8\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 1 July to June.\n \n 80\n \n 60\n \n 40\n \n 20\n \n 0\n \n 250\n \n 200\n \n 150\n \n 100\n \n 50\n \n 0\n \n 8\n \n 6\n \n 4\n \n 2\n \n 0\n \n 7\n 1\n /\n 6\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 8\n 1\n /\n 7\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 9\n 1\n /\n 8\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 7\n 1\n /\n 6\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 8\n 1\n /\n 7\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 9\n 1\n /\n 8\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 7\n 1\n /\n 6\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 8\n 1\n /\n 7\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n 9\n 1\n /\n 8\n 1\n 0\n 2\n \n The global presence of the Schaffner Group, with production centers in Asia, Europe and the USA, substantially reduces trans-\n port costs. For the transport needs that do arise, the share of air freight is continually and systematically lowered in favor of sea \n freight, which allows a further decrease in CO2 emissions (per unit of weight and distance). However, as a result of the manu-\n facturing disruption after the fire in Thailand, an additional volume of freight temporarily had to be transported by air in fiscal \n 2017/18 to avoid delays in deliveries to customers. This led to a short-term increase in CO2 emissions. Once the supply situa-\n tion normalized, the CO2 output was cut again markedly in fiscal 2018/19, to well below the pre-fire level. \n \n The absolute amount of CO2 emitted in connection with business travel eased slightly in fiscal 2018/19, while seeing a small \n increase in relation to sales. In China and Thailand, Schaffner also offers free employee transportation to and from work and \n thus helps reduce the CO2 emissions caused by individual commuting.\n \n In Hungary, additional initiatives for the reduction and reuse of waste were launched. For example, greater awareness was pro-\n moted among all staff and waste separation was further optimized.\n \n At the new headquarters in Luterbach, employees use reusable rather than disposable coffee cups. As well, the availability of \n chilled sparkling water on tap eliminates the need for PET bottles.\n \n The reported increase in waste generation is due to a past error in data collection. Previously at the plant in Thailand, not all \n materials that were recycled were recorded as waste. This was corrected in fiscal year 2018/19, leading to a rise in the amount \n of waste reported relative to sales.\n \n The significant increase in water consumption in fiscal 2018/19 resulted entirely from the construction of the new building in \n Thailand.\n \n \fCorporate governance \n \n 2018\n 19\n \n Contents\n \n Basis of the corporate governance report\n \n Board of Directors\n Executive Committee\n \n 21 \n 21  Governance-related events in fiscal year 2018/19\n 21  Group structure and significant shareholders\n 24  Capital structure\n 27 \n 34 \n 38  Compensation, share ownership and loans\n 38 \n 40  Change-of-control clauses and takeover defenses\n 41   Auditors\n 42   Communication policy\n \n Shareholder participation rights\n \n \f21\n \n 1  Basis of the corporate governance report\n \n This corporate governance report of Schaffner Holding AG (“the Company”) describes the principles of governance and control \n of the Schaffner Group, based on the Directive on Information Relating to Corporate Governance (DCG) issued by the SIX Swiss \n Exchange.

The issued shares are fully paid. Each share carries one vote at the General Meeting. All shares not held by \n the Company or by one of its subsidiaries carry dividend and voting rights.\n \n 4.2  Authorized unissued capital\n \n 4.2.1  Authorized capital for equity-based compensation \n Schaffner Holding AG does not have unissued authorized capital designated for use in equity compensation plans (such capital is re-\n ferred to in German as “bedingtes Kapital”). \n \n 4.2.2  Other authorized capital\n The other authorized capital (i.e., authorized capital for purposes other than equity compensation; in German: genehmigtes Kapital) \n created by the Annual General Meeting on 12 January 2016 was not utilized within the period allowed, which ended 13 January \n 2017. Schaffner Holding AG currently does not have such other authorized capital.\n \n 4.3  Changes in equity in the last three fiscal years\n The Annual General Meetings on 18 January 2018 (for fiscal year 2016/17) and 15 January 2019 each passed a resolution to distrib-\n ute CHF 6.50 per share (exempt from Swiss anticipatory tax) to shareholders in the form of a repayment of excess share premium. \n For fiscal year 2015/16 no dividend was paid.\n \n The changes in share capital, in share premium, in retained earnings and in the other components of consolidated equity are pre-\n sented in detail in the consolidated financial statements, on page 58 of this annual report 2018/19. The comparative information \n on changes in equity for the three prior years is found on page 60 of the consolidated financial statements in the annual report \n 2017/18, on page 59 of the annual report 2016/17 and page 64 of the annual report 2015/16.\n \n 4.4  Shares and participation certificates\n \n 4.4.1  Shares\n The 635,940 issued shares of Schaffner Holding AG have a nominal value of CHF 32.50 per share. Each share carries one vote and \n is entitled to dividends.\n \n Subject to provisions (i), (ii) and (iii) below, the shares are issued in uncertificated form and maintained as book-entry securities.\n \n Transfers of or dispositions regarding book-entry securities, including the granting of interests therein as collateral, are subject to \n the Swiss Federal Act on Book-Entry Securities. If uncertificated shares are transferred by assignment, the transfer is valid only if \n notified to the Company.\n \n (i)  Shares maintained as book-entry securities may be withdrawn from the custody system by the Company.\n \n (ii)  Shareholders are not entitled to require the printing and delivery of certificates (physical securities) or the conversion of reg-\n istered shares issued in one form into another form. The Company may, however, at any time print and deliver certificates (single \n share certificates, collective certificates or global certificates) or convert uncertificated or certificated shares into another form, and \n may cancel issued certificates that are returned to the Company. Shareholders that are registered in the share register may at any \n time request a certification of ownership of their shares from the Company.\n \n Corporate governance \f25\n \n (iii)  By amending the Articles of Association, the General Meeting of shareholders may at any time convert registered shares into \n bearer shares or bearer shares into registered shares.\n \n 4.4.2  Participation certificates\n There were no participation certificates of Schaffner Holding AG at 30 September 2019 (participation certificates, or Partizipa-\n tionsscheine in German, essentially are a type of preference share).\n \n 4.5  Dividend right certificates\n Schaffner Holding AG had not issued any dividend right certificates as of 30 September 2019 (dividend right certificates, or \n Genussscheine in German, essentially are preference shares for related parties).\n \n 4.6  Restrictions on transferability and nominee registration\n Registered shares of Schaffner Holding AG may be acquired by all legal or natural persons. The purchase of Schaffner shares is \n subject to registration restrictions concerning the recognition and registration of share purchasers, and of nominees, as voting \n shareholders. These restrictions are specified in detail in the Share Registration Regulation of Schaffner Holding AG. The Share \n Registration Regulation was issued by the Board of Directors in reliance on sections 685a and 685d et seq. of the Swiss Code of \n Obligations and article 6 of the Articles of Association, and can be viewed under the “Annual General Meeting” tab found on the \n following web page of the Schaffner Group: \n www.schaffner-ir.com/news-presentations/news\n \n 4.6.1  Recognition of share purchasers as voting shareholders\n Shareholders or beneficial owners are deemed to be those persons registered in the Company’s share register. In accordance with \n article 6 para. 3 of the Articles of Association of Schaffner Holding AG, purchasers of shares are upon their request recorded as \n voting shareholders in the share register by the Board of Directors if the purchasers expressly state that they have acquired and will \n hold the shares for their own account. Recognition as a shareholder with voting rights thus requires both that the shareholder in \n question bears the economic risk incident to ownership of the shares to be registered, and that, in the application for registration, \n the shareholder expressly declares to the Company that the shareholder has acquired and will hold the shares for the shareholder’s \n own account. In reliance on article 6 para. 3 of the Articles of Association and the recognition requirements derived from it, ap-\n plicants (purchasers holding legal title to the shares) are thus not recognized as voting shareholders if they have acquired, and are \n holding, the shares as a result of a securities lending transaction or similar transaction that gives them legal ownership without the \n associated economic risk.\n \n 4.6.2  Registration of share purchasers\n For each registration in the share register as a voting shareholder, a personally signed registration application or a registration \n authorization must be on file at the respective SIX SIS AG custodian bank, containing all of the following information:\n \n  › For individuals: Last name, first name, nationality, and address\n  ›  For legal entities: Entity name, registered office, and address\n \n Every registration in the share register requires evidence of the acquisition of full legal title to the shares or evidence of the establish-\n ment of beneficial ownership, and always requires an express declaration that the shares were acquired and are held by the applicant \n in the applicant’s own name and for the applicant’s own account.\n \n In the case of registration applications by shareholders holding the shares for their own account where the applicant has reported \n holding 3% or more of the voting rights of Schaffner Holding AG, the registration is not performed until the Company has received \n a complete disclosure notification by the applicant pursuant to section 120 of the Financial Market Infrastructure Act (also referred \n \n Corporate governance\f26\n \n to in German as FinfraG). If the disclosure notification meets the legal requirements (i.e., contains the legally required information \n about the beneficial owner), the applicant (i.e., the acquired stock) is registered in the share register as having voting rights. If the \n disclosure notification is not made within the 20-day deadline specified in section 685g of the Swiss Code of Obligations, or is \n incomplete, the application for registration with voting rights is denied and the shareholder (i.e., the acquired stock) is registered \n in the share register as non-voting.\n \n 4.6.3  Registration of nominees\n Persons who do not expressly declare in their registration application that they hold the shares for their own account are classified as \n nominees. In accordance with article 6 para. 4 of the Articles of Association, by default any single nominee is registered in the share \n register as holding voting shares only up to a maximum of 5% of the Company’s share capital recorded in the Swiss commercial register \n of companies. Above this limit of 5%, the Board of Directors registers shares of nominees in the share register as voting shares only if:\n \n (i) the nominee discloses the names, addresses and holdings of Company shares of the persons for whose account the nominee holds \n 0.5% or more of the total registered-share capital recorded in the commercial register, and\n \n (ii) an agreement exists between the nominee and the Company which specifies the nominee’s position and the details of the nominee’s \n notification obligations.\n \n The registrar (the company retained to operate the share register) is responsible for sending the nominee agreement to the respective \n nominee and collecting the information to be disclosed. If complete disclosure is not made by the 20-day deadline specified in section \n 685g of the Swiss Code of Obligations, or if no nominee agreement is concluded between the Company and the nominee within this \n period, the nominee is registered in the share register as non-voting in respect of these shares. To the extent permitted by law, the Board \n of Directors is authorized to enter into agreements with nominees regarding reporting obligations. On a case-by-case basis, the Board \n may approve exceptions to the nominee rules.\n \n Where legal entities or groups with joint legal status are related to one another by capital, voting rights, management or in some other \n manner, they are deemed collectively to constitute a single purchaser. This also applies to all natural persons, legal entities or groups \n with joint legal status that by agreement, as a syndicate or in any other way act in a coordinated manner with a view to circumventing \n the nominee rules. The Company may void registrations in the share register with retroactive effect from the date of registration if they \n were based on false information given by the purchaser. The purchaser must be informed of the deletion immediately.\n \n Registered non-voting shareholders and registered non-voting nominees cannot exercise the voting rights associated with the shares \n nor exercise other rights related to the voting rights. However, they are not restricted in exercising any of their other shareholder rights, \n including pre-emptive rights. At the General Meeting the shares registered as non-voting are treated as unrepresented (see section 685 \n f (2) and (3) of the Swiss Code of Obligations).\n \n The registration restrictions described above also apply to shares bought or subscribed through the exercise of pre-emptive rights, \n options or conversion rights.\n \n At 30 September 2019, 15.2% (prior year: 19.7%) of all issued shares were unregistered or were registered as non-voting shares.\n \n Corporate governance \f27\n \n 4.7 \n \n Convertible bonds and options\n \n 4.7.1  Convertible bonds\n There are no outstanding convertible bonds of Schaffner Holding AG.\n \n 4.7.2  Share option plans\n The share option plan for upper management and members of the Board of Directors of the Schaffner Group (the Employee Share \n Option Plan) expired on 21 November 2018. As of 30 September 2019, Schaffner Holding AG no longer has a share option plan.\n \n 5  Board of Directors\n \n 5.1  Members of the Board\n The Articles of Association require the Board of Directors of Schaffner Holding AG to have between three and seven members.\n \n On 30 September 2019 the Board of Directors consisted of five, non-executive members. In the three years prior to the reporting \n period (fiscal years 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18), none of these Board members were members of Schaffner’s Executive Com-\n mittee or of the management of a subsidiary, and none had or have material business relationships with the Schaffner Group. The \n members of the Board of Schaffner Holding AG are thus independent within the meaning of the Swiss Code of Best Practice for \n Corporate Governance issued by Economiesuisse, the Swiss business federation.\n \n In fiscal year 2018/19 the Board of Directors of Schaffner Holding AG had the following members:\n \n Urs Kaufmann, Chairman, born 1962, member of the Board since 2017\n Degree in Engineering, Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich; Senior Executive Program, IMD, Lausanne\n Since 2017 is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Huber+Suhner AG, Herisau.

However, in urgent matters they immediately inform the Chairman of the \n Board or the Chief Executive Officer, at any time.

The Board convenes as often as business requires or when a Board member requests it, but not less than once per \n quarter. Board meetings are normally called in writing, stating the agenda items. The agenda is set by the Chairman, who also \n includes items proposed by the Executive Committee. Board meetings are called at least ten days before the meeting date. In \n urgent matters, the requirement for written notice and/or for ten days’ notice can be waived, in which case this must be noted \n in the minutes of the meeting.\n \n The Board of Directors has a quorum when the majority of its members are in attendance for oral discussions and votes. Mem-\n bers may also be present by telephone or via electronic media (for example, videoconferencing). Resolutions are passed by a \n simple majority of votes. In the event of an equality of votes, the chairman of the meeting has a second or casting vote. For the \n purpose of resolutions concerning capital increases, the Board has a quorum irrespective of the number of members present. \n Unless a member requests an oral discussion, the Board may also vote on its resolutions by written ballot (submitted by mail, \n \n Corporate governance\f32\n \n fax or e-mail). In such a “postal” vote (also known as a written resolution), passage of a resolution requires the affirmative vote \n of the majority of all Board members. Postal votes and their outcome must be recorded in the minutes of the next meeting.\n \n The Chairman of the Board (or if unavailable, the Vice Chairman or another deputy) prepares and chairs the meetings of the \n Board. He is responsible for the proper calling and conducting of the meetings and for the timely and appropriate briefing of \n the Board members.\n \n In the reporting period the Board met nine times.

Each share of Schaffner Holding AG, with the \n exception of any shares held by the Company (treasury shares), carries one vote at the General Meeting of shareholders. There are no \n restrictions on voting rights.\n \n Every shareholder with voting rights may have his shares represented by the independent proxy or by a proxy that the shareholder has \n appointed. The proxy need not be a shareholder.\n \n Representation of shareholders requires the presentation of a written proxy (a written power of attorney), the recognition of which is a \n matter for the Board of Directors. Shareholders may also use electronic means to issue proxy mandates and directions to the independent \n proxy.\n \n In the notice of the General Meeting, the Board of Directors announces the record date (at which registration in the share register is \n required for participation in and voting at the meeting), and the details of the written and electronic proxies and instructions.\n \n The General Meeting annually elects an independent proxy, whose term of office ends at the conclusion of the next Annual General \n Meeting.

The Articles of Association of Schaffner Holding \n AG do not provide for quorums that go beyond the provisions of Swiss corporation law.\n \n Corporate governance \f39\n \n 8.3  Calling of the General Meeting\n The General Meeting is called by the Board of Directors no later than 20 days before the meeting date, by issuing a notice in the Com-\n pany’s official gazette for statutory notices. Notice of the meeting may additionally be sent by letter to all shareholders registered in \n the share register. In addition to the meeting date, hour and place, the notice must state the items of business to be discussed and the \n resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors and any proposed by shareholders that have requested a General Meeting or have put \n forward an item for discussion at the meeting.\n \n Resolutions cannot be passed on matters that have not been announced in this manner, except for motions to call an Extraordinary \n General Meeting or to conduct a special audit.\n \n Shareholders representing at least 10% of the share capital may submit a request – which is binding on the Company – to call an \n Extraordinary General Meeting. Such a request must be in writing and state the business to be discussed and the proposed resolutions.\n \n 8.4  Placing business on the General Meeting agenda\n One or more shareholders who together represent at least 5% of the share capital, or shares with a nominal value of at least CHF \n 1,000,000, whichever is less, may by their written request have business placed on the agenda of a General Meeting; the request must \n state the proposed resolutions. Such a request must be received by the Company no later than 45 days before the General Meeting.\n \n 8.5  Registration in the share register\n In accordance with article 6 para. 1 of the Articles of Association, Schaffner Holding AG maintains a share register. The Company \n may outsource the operation of the share register to a company specializing in such services (a registrar). At present the share register \n is operated by ShareCommService AG, based in Glattbrugg, Switzerland. The manager of the share register is Schaffner’s CFO. In \n matters concerning the share register, the CFO reports to the Chairman of the Board. The Chairman and the CEO receive regular \n reports on the shareholder structure (including share deregistrations above a certain size of shareholding). The Board of Directors \n annually receives a report on the shareholder structure.\n \n The Share Registration Regulation of Schaffner Holding AG sets out the details of the rules governing registration in the share register, \n including particularly the related authority structure, the maintenance of the share register, and the monitoring of the shareholdings \n recorded in it. The Share Registration Regulation was issued by the Board of Directors in reliance on sections 685a and 685d et seq. of \n the Swiss Code of Obligations and article 6 of the Articles of Association. The Regulation can be viewed under the “Annual General \n Meeting” tab found at: \n www.schaffner-ir.com/annual-general-meeting/documentation\n \n Further information regarding restrictions on transferability and nominee registrations is given on page 25 of this corporate governance \n report in section 4.6.\n \n Shares for which the requirements (as set out in the Share Registration Regulation or in any amendments thereto) for registration as \n a voting shareholder are not, or no longer, fulfilled are registered in the share register as non-voting shares.\n \n These registration restrictions also apply to shares bought or subscribed through the exercise of options, pre-emptive rights or conver-\n sion rights.\n \n The authority structure for the approval of shareholder registrations in the share register is as follows:\n \n  › Registration applications for up to 5,000 shares per transaction that clearly do or clearly do not meet the requirements for regis-\n tration as a voting shareholder or nominee: Approval by the registrar (the company commissioned to operate the share register)\n \n Corporate governance\f40\n \n  › Applications for registration as a nominee: Approval by the registrar\n  › Registration applications for more than 5,000 shares per transaction, and all other transactions which do not clearly meet the \n requirements for registration as a voting shareholder or voting nominee, or in which there is uncertainty: Approval by the \n manager of the share register\n  › All registration applications of shareholders or groups of shareholders that hold the shares for their own account and have \n reported holding 3% or more of the voting rights of Schaffner Holding AG: Approval by the manager of the share register\n \n Exceptional cases can at any time be referred for approval to the Chairman or, if absent, to the Vice Chairman of the Board.\n \n The Board may, after hearing the affected party, void (delete) the party’s registration in the share register as a voting shareholder, \n retroactively to the date of registration, if the registration was the result of false information supplied by the purchaser, and instead \n register the affected party as a non-voting shareholder. Registrations can also be deleted (or reclassified as non-voting) when a regis-\n tered shareholder refuses, despite prior warning, to provide the requested information or fails to provide requested documentation (of \n beneficial ownership, etc.). The authority to decide on deleting or reclassifying the registration of a voting shareholder or nominee or \n on terminating the relationship with a nominee rests with the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The purchaser must be informed \n of the deletion immediately.\n \n Under article 13 para. 4 of the Articles of Association, in the notice of the General Meeting the Board of Directors announces the \n record date at which registration in the share register is required for participation in and voting at the meeting, and thereby indicates \n the length of the period for which the share register will be closed. The record date for registration is generally the fifth trading day \n before the day of the General Meeting. Accordingly, the closure of the share register is generally in effect from the fourth trading day \n before the day of the General Meeting until and including the day of the General Meeting.\n \n Deletions from the share register can be made during the closure. Thus, despite the closure, a share seller is struck from the share register \n to the extent of the shares sold, if the sale is reported to the Company or to the manager of the share register during the closure. An \n admission ticket for the General Meeting already issued in the seller’s name is automatically rendered void by the deletion from the \n share register. In the event of the partial sale of a shareholding, the delivered admission ticket must be exchanged at the registration \n desk on the day of the General Meeting. The invitation to the General Meeting shall note this requirement.\n \n 9  Change-of-control clauses and takeover defenses\n \n 9.1  Requirement to make a public tender offer\n The Articles of Association of Schaffner Holding AG contain neither an opting-up nor an opting-out clause. Therefore, any person \n or entity acquiring one-third (33⅓%) or more of the voting rights of Schaffner Holding AG must, under section 135 para. 1 of the \n Financial Market Infrastructure Act, make a public tender offer for all remaining shares.\n \n 9.2  Clauses on changes of control\n In either of the following two cases, the participants in the Schaffner Holding AG Restricted Share Plan (RSP) and Long-Term \n Incentive Plan (LTIP) have the right to immediately sell some or all of their shares, without regard to the holding periods:\n \n  › If any person or entity directly or indirectly acquires sufficient shares in the Company to become obligated under section \n 135 para. 1 Financial Market Infrastructure Act to make a tender offer for all other outstanding shares of the Company, or\n  › If Schaffner Holding AG sells all or a substantial portion of the Company’s assets.\n \n Corporate governance \f41\n \n 10    Auditors\n \n 10.1  Duration of audit firm’s engagement and tenure of lead audit partner\n \n 10.1.1  Starting date of current audit engagement\n The external independent audit firm is elected annually by the General Meeting. Since fiscal year 2015/16, BDO AG, Solo-\n thurn, is the independent auditor of Schaffner Holding AG and, as the Group’s audit firm, is responsible for the auditing of the \n Schaffner Group.\n \n 10.1.2  Date of first appointment of lead audit partner\n The lead audit partner at the external auditors (the person in charge of the audit engagement), Beat Rüfenacht, has held this position \n since fiscal year 2015/16. The lead audit partner’s tenure is limited by law to seven years.\n \n 10.2  Audit fees\n In fiscal year 2018/19, BDO AG billed the Schaffner Group a total of CHF 226 thousand for services in connection with the \n auditing of the company financial statements of Schaffner Holding AG and the consolidated financial statements of the Schaffner \n Group (prior year: CHF 203 thousand).\n \n 10.3  Additional fees\n In addition, BDO AG invoiced the Schaffner Group CHF 6 thousand (CHF 10 thousand) for other services, which had the \n following composition:\n \n In CHF ’000\n Tax consulting\n Miscellaneous \n \n  \n \n 2018/19\n 0\n 6\n \n 2017/18\n 0\n 10\n \n 10.4  Informational instruments pertaining to external audits\n The Risk and Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board of Directors, annually reviews the license, performance, fees and inde-\n pendence of the external auditors and recommends to the Board which external auditors to propose for election by the General \n Meeting. It also ensures compliance with the legal requirement for rotation of the lead audit partner. The external auditors in the \n course of their audit activities regularly communicate their findings to the Risk and Audit Committee, along with any suggestions \n for improvement. The external auditors report to the Board in a comprehensive management letter (prepared after the audit of the \n annual financial statements) and through the “reports of the statutory auditor” published in the annual report.\n \n The Risk and Audit Committee meets with the external auditors at least two times per year, sets the scope and objectives of the \n audits, and annually assesses the work of the external audit firm through a performance evaluation process. This process takes into \n account the committee’s experience in working with the external audit firm and the audit firm’s own quality assurance measures in \n respect of the engagement. The Risk and Audit Committee obtains assurance that the lead audit partner has the necessary technical \n qualifications and fulfills the requirements as to independence. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer also attend \n these meetings. The Board is briefed by the Risk and Audit Committee.\n \n Corporate governance\f42\n \n 11    Communication policy\n \n Schaffner follows a policy of open and active communication. As a company listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Schaffner \n Group especially communicates information relevant to the share price (so-called “ad-hoc” disclosures), in accordance with \n section 53 and 54 of the Listing Rules. The Group’s financial reporting is in accordance with Swiss GAAP FER accounting \n standards. Where the Schaffner Group makes forward-looking statements, these statements are always based on management’s \n judgment, at the time of the statement, regarding the current and future position and performance of the company.

It describes how the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee is \n determined, and gives information on the specific compensation provided to them. It fulfills the requirements of the Ordinance Against \n Excessive Compensation at Listed Companies (OAEC) which took effect in January 2014, and thus complies with the Swiss Code of \n Obligations. The compensation report is based on the Directive on Information Relating to Corporate Governance (The Corporate \n Governance Directive) issued by the SIX Swiss Exchange and on the Articles of Association of Schaffner Holding AG. It also takes \n into account the recommendations of the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance published by Economiesuisse, the \n Swiss business federation.\n \n In the Articles of Association of Schaffner Holding AG, the complete provisions concerning the various aspects of compensation \n are found in the following articles: the compensation principles, in article 24; the approval of compensation by the Annual General \n Meeting, in article 25; the available additional amount for compensation of the Executive Committee where a previously approved \n aggregate maximum amount is not sufficient, in article 26; the rules regarding the principles of performance-related compensation, in \n article 28; the granting of shares, in article 29; and the granting of loans, other credit and pension benefits, in article 30. Article 19 sets \n out the responsibilities of the Nomination and Compensation Committee. In the Organizational Regulations of Schaffner Holding \n AG (a document known in German as Organisationsreglement that sets out the Company’s governance structure and policies), the \n corresponding provisions are covered in section 2.4, Responsibilities of the Board of Directors. The Articles of Association and the \n Organizational Regulations are available in the Corporate Governance section of the website of Schaffner Holding AG at:\n www.schaffner-ir.com/corporate-governance/articles-of-association-organizational-regulations\n \n 2  Guiding principles\n \n The success of the Schaffner Group is driven in large measure by the quality, entrepreneurship and commitment of its people. The \n compensation policy aims to attract qualified managers and staff, align their activities with the long-term corporate goals and the \n interests of shareholders, and ensure the competitive attractiveness of a career in the Schaffner Group. The compensation policy of \n the Schaffner Group is guided by the following criteria:\n \n  › Performance-based and market-competitive, with fixed and variable compensation elements\n  › Targets that are clearly defined and measurable\n  ›  Promotion of the Group’s financial and business success\n  ›  Fairness and transparency in decisions on compensation\n  ›  Balance of short-term and long-term compensation with defined upper and lower limits\n \n 3  Responsibility and procedures for determining compensation\n \n The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the structuring and allocation of compensation. The compensation \n models used for the Board and the Executive Committee are set out in a compensation policy approved by the Board. The \n Board of Directors is supported in its work by the Nomination and Compensation Committee (NCC). The NCC reviews \n the compensation principles and prepares all relevant decisions on the compensation of the Board and the Executive Com-\n mittee. From among the Board members, the General Meeting annually elects at least two members to the Nomination and  \n Compensation Committee. The composition, responsibilities and operation of the NCC are described in the corporate gov-\n ernance report 2018/19 of Schaffner Holding AG in section 5.5.2.1 on page 30.\n \n Compensation report\f46\n \n The Board of Directors annually submits a proposal to the Annual General Meeting for the approval of a maximum aggregate \n amount of compensation for the Board of Directors for the period until the next AGM and for the Executive Committee for \n the fiscal year (1 October to 30 September) next following the AGM.\n \n Each year at the AGM, binding votes are held on the maximum aggregate amounts. If the AGM declines to approve the max-\n imum aggregate amount for the Executive Committee and/or the Board of Directors, the Board may convene a new General \n Meeting.\n \n Compensation and approval mechanism\n \n (cid:31)(cid:30)(cid:29)(cid:28)(cid:27) (cid:30)(cid:25) \n (cid:27)(cid:24)(cid:28)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:21)(cid:30)(cid:28)(cid:20)\n \n (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:17)(cid:23) \n (cid:22)(cid:30)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:23)\n \n Compensation report \n for ﬁscal 2018/19\n \n CONSULTATIVE\n VOTE\n \n Maximum aggregate \n amount for compensation \n of the Board of Directors \n for the period until the \n next Annual General \n Meeting (AGM 2021)\n \n G\n N\n \n I\n T\n E\n E\n M\n \n  \n L\n A\n R\n E\n N\n E\n G\n  \n L\n A\n U\n N\n N\n A\n \n RESOLUTION\n \n RESOLUTION\n \n Maximum aggregate \n amount for compensation \n of the Executive Committee \n for ﬁscal 2020/21\n \n 1 Oct 2018\n \n  AGM 2019\n \n 30 Sep 2019\n \n AGM 2020\n \n 1 Oct 2020\n \n  AGM 2021\n \n 30 Sep 2021\n \n 4  Compensation system for the Board of Directors \n \n 4.1  Non-executive members of the Board\n The compensation of the Board of Directors is set annually subject to the maximum aggregate amount approved by the AGM. The \n compensation is paid partly in cash and partly in the form of a fixed number of shares of Schaffner Holding AG. The Schaffner \n shares represent compensation designed to further the long-term performance of the Schaffner Group; they have a holding period \n of at least three years, during which they cannot be sold. The proportion of total compensation paid in the form of Schaffner shares \n is regularly reviewed by the NCC. Proposals for changes are submitted to the Board of Directors.\n \n The compensation of the members of the Board is governed by article 24 para. 1 of the Articles of Association and has the following \n components:\n \n a) Fixed cash compensation\n Each member of the Board receives a fixed annual base compensation in cash (in fiscal year 2018/19: Chairman: CHF 170 thou-\n sand; other members: CHF 47 thousand). In addition, Board members receive a flat fee for their work on the Board committees \n (2018/19: committee chair: CHF 5 thousand; other committee members: CHF 3 thousand). This flat committee fee is paid only \n once per person, even if the recipient sits on several committees; the fee is included within the item fixed cash compensation.\n \n Compensation report\f47\n \n b) Long-term compensation in shares of the Company\n The Board members each also receive long-term compensation in the form of a fixed number of shares of the Company with a \n holding period of at least three years.\n \n 4.1.1 Additional information\n The compensation of the Board members is reviewed annually and, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, \n is set prospectively by the full Board of Directors for the term of office beginning immediately after the AGM and ending at the \n conclusion of the next AGM. Reimbursement of expenses is not considered compensation.\n \n The amount of the compensation for the individual Board members is set on a discretionary basis, taking into consideration the \n amount of responsibility assigned, the complexity of the duties involved, the required professional and personal qualifications \n and the expected demands on the Board member’s time. The determination of compensation also takes into account an external \n benchmark in the form of a specific peer group of Swiss manufacturing companies. The composition of the peer group is described \n in the section on the compensation system for the Executive Committee.\n \n No pension benefits or significant benefits in kind are provided to members of the Board of Directors.\n \n Loans and other credit granted by the Company to a member of the Board of Directors, or guarantees or other security provided \n by the Company for obligations of a Board member, must not exceed CHF 50 thousand.\n \n 4.2  Executive members of the Board\n The Board of Directors of Schaffner Holding AG has only non-executive members.\n \n 5  Compensation system for the Executive Committee\n \n The total compensation for a given member of the Executive Committee is determined by the Board of Directors by taking into \n consideration the following factors:\n \n  › External benchmark data from a defined peer group\n  › Ensuring equal treatment within the Company\n  › Amount of responsibility assigned, job qualifications, complexity of duties, and level of target achievement\n \n The peer group used as a benchmark for comparison is selected from Swiss-based, internationally operating manufacturing companies \n in the Swiss Performance Index (SPI). The selection criteria are annual sales, number of employees, industry within the manufac-\n turing sector, and similar complexity of structures (divisional structure, diversified product portfolio, international activities, etc.). \n The peer group includes the following companies among others: Adval Tech Holding AG, Carlo Gavazzi Holding AG, Kardex \n AG and Tornos Holding AG.\n \n When required, to help determine Executive Committee compensation, the Board uses international compensation analyses for \n relevant management positions by a consulting firm specializing in salary benchmarking. The consulting firm involved has no other \n role with the Schaffner Group.\n \n The compensation of the members of the Executive Committee is governed by article 24 para. 2 of the Articles of Association and \n has the following components:\n \n Compensation report\f48\n \n a) Fixed cash compensation\n The members of the Executive Committee receive a fixed base salary, which is paid monthly. The amount is determined by the \n Board individually for each member and on a discretionary basis, taking into account the role and amount of responsibility of \n the individual.\n \n b) Variable cash compensation\n The variable cash compensation is performance-based. It is tied to the achievement of corporate financial targets and personal \n targets.\n \n The corporate financial targets are set annually in advance for a one-year performance period. In fiscal year 2018/19 these target \n metrics were Group net sales and EBIT, segment sales and EBIT, and Group net working capital. In fiscal 2017/18 the target \n metrics were Group net sales and EBIT and segment sales and EBIT.\n \n The personal annual targets are set individually for each member of the Executive Committee before the start of the assessment \n period. They relate to current projects, the agreed strategic goals, and longer-term company performance and development.\n \n Target achievement is evaluated by the Board after the end of the fiscal year. The target amount is contractually set and cannot \n exceed 50% of fixed compensation. The variable cash compensation can increase up to a maximum of 150% of the target amount \n if all targets are significantly surpassed, and can fall to 0% of the target amount if the targets are not achieved.\n \n The weighting of the criteria used in determining the variable compensation is as follows:\n \n Position\n \n Group financial targets\n \n Personal targets\n \n Chief Executive Officer\n \n Other members of the  \n Executive Committee\n \n 60%\n \n 40%–60%\n \n 40%\n \n 40%–60%\n \n c) Long-term compensation in shares of the Company\n As long-term compensation, the members of the Executive Committee of Schaffner are annually awarded a variable number of \n shares of Schaffner Holding AG. The Schaffner shares represent compensation designed to further the long-term performance \n of the Schaffner Group and have a holding period of at least three years, during which they cannot be sold. They are awarded \n (granted) according to the following principles.\n \n Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP), in effect since fiscal year 2018/19 \n Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the Board of Directors sets a target number of shares for each member of the Exec-\n utive Committee. Once the annual financial statements are available, the Board, based on an assessment of the Group’s financial \n situation, outlook, market environment, progress in strategy execution, and the personal performance of the respective member of \n the Executive Committee, determines an individual target-achievement factor that can range from 0.5 to 1.5. The effective number \n of shares to be granted is calculated by multiplying the target number of shares by the individual achievement factor. The shares \n carry voting and dividend rights from the date of the award (the grant date) and are subject to a holding period of at least three \n years. As the LTIP involves a vesting period, the expense is recognized over the course of the entire vesting period.\n \n Compensation report\f49\n \n Restricted Share Plan (RSP), in effect until fiscal year 2017/18\n Until the end of fiscal 2017/18, the number of shares to be awarded was decided in the discretion of the Board of Directors. The \n shares carried voting and dividend rights from the date of the award and were subject to a holding period of at least three years. As \n the awards under the Restricted Share Plan did not have a vesting period, they were disclosed in the compensation report in the \n year of the grant. \n \n d) Pension and other compensation\n Pension benefits of Executive Committee members accrue only under pension plans and similar plans of the Company or its Group \n companies. The benefits of the plan participants and the employer contributions follow from the pension plans or from the respec-\n tive sets of regulations. Depending on their specific position and country of residence, members of the Executive Committee are \n in some cases provided with a company car. As well, additional compensation may be paid in connection with postings to other \n countries (i.e., for expatriates). In the disclosures below, the value of any company car privileges and out-of-country allowances is \n reported under “other compensation”.\n \n 5.1  Additional information\n When new members join the Executive Committee, they are compensated in this capacity from the month in which they take up \n the position. When a member leaves the Executive Committee, compensation is paid until the date of departure. The variable cash \n compensation and the share award can be reduced or canceled by the Board of Directors.\n \n The compensation of the Executive Committee is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors. Every year, the Board proposes to \n shareholders at the Annual General Meeting the maximum aggregate compensation of the Executive Committee for the next fiscal \n year after the date of the AGM (the year beginning on the following 1 October).\n \n 5.2  Additional amount for members of the Executive Committee\n If new members are appointed to, or existing members are promoted within, the Executive Committee and assume their new position \n after the AGM has approved the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Executive Committee for the respective fiscal \n year, then these new or promoted members may, for the period to the next AGM, be paid, in the case of a new CEO, up to 25% more \n than the amount which had been allocated to the previous CEO out of the maximum aggregate compensation last approved by the \n AGM for the whole Executive Committee, and in the case of a non-CEO member of the Executive Committee, be paid up to 25% \n more than the average total compensation per non-CEO member had been as per said last-approved maximum aggregate amount. \n The additional amount for members of the Executive Committee is governed by article 24 para. 26 of the Articles of Association.\n \n 5.3  Employment contracts\n The members of the Executive Committee are generally employed under permanent contracts; all permanent contracts have notice \n periods of at most one year. There is no contractual advance compensation and no severance pay for Executive Committee members.\n \n Compensation report\f50\n \n 6  Compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and \n  \n \n Executive Committee for fiscal year 2018/19\n \n 6.1  Compensation of the members of the Board of Directors for 2018/19\n In the fiscal year under review, the members of the Board received aggregate fixed compensation of CHF 377 thousand (prior \n year: CHF 382 thousand). In addition, aggregate share-based compensation of CHF 156 thousand was granted under the RSP \n (prior year: CHF 228 thousand). This amount is based on the market value of a total of 625 shares (prior year: 725 shares), with \n a share price of CHF 251.00 on 3 January 2019 (prior year: CHF 315.00). Additionally, a total of 418 shares were granted on 29 \n November 2019 for recognition as an expense in fiscal year 2018/19 under the new LTIP (prior year: not applicable) at a share \n price of CHF 217.00.\n \n The aggregate total compensation of the Board of Directors in the fiscal year under review was CHF 625 thousand (prior year: \n CHF 610 thousand). As the new share ownership plan (the LTIP) is associated with a vesting period, the shares granted under the \n LTIP are recognized in the year of vesting, using accrual accounting. The expired share ownership plan (the RSP) did not have a \n vesting period and expenses under it were thus recognized in the year of the actual grant. In fiscal 2018/19, this had the one-time \n transitional effect that expenses under both plans were recognized in the same fiscal year, despite the fact that no dual grant was made.\n \n Compensation of the members of the Board of Directors\n \n Fixed cash  \n compensation  \n in CHF ‘000\n 2017/18\n \n 2018/19\n \n Urs Kaufmann, Board Chairman4\n Daniel Hirschi, until January 2018 \n Philipp Buhofer,  \n Board Vice Chairman5, 7\n Gerhard Pegam, Board member7\n Suzanne Thoma, Board member5\n Georg Wechsler, Board member6\n Total\n \n 175\n n/a\n 50\n \n 50\n 50\n 52\n 377\n \n 166\n 14\n 50\n \n 50\n 50\n 52\n 382\n \n Share-based compensation\n in CHF ‘000\n \n Total compensation\n in CHF ‘000\n \n Number of shares granted\n \n 2018/19\n RSP1\n 56\n n/a\n 25\n \n LTIP2, 3\n 3.3\n n/a\n 15\n \n 2017/18\n RSP1\n 71\n 32\n 32\n \n 25\n 25\n 25\n 156\n \n 15\n 15\n 15\n 91\n \n 32\n 32\n 32\n 228\n \n 2018/19\n \n 2017/18\n \n 264\n n/a\n 90\n \n 90\n 90\n 92\n 625\n \n 237\n 56\n 82\n \n 82\n 82\n 84\n 610\n \n 2018/19\n RSP\n 225\n n/a\n 100\n \n 100\n 100\n 100\n 625\n \n LTIP3\n 150\n n/a\n 67\n \n 67\n 67\n 67\n 418\n \n 2017/18\n RSP\n 225\n 100\n 100\n \n 100\n 100\n 100\n 725\n \n 1  Measured at the closing share price at the grant date: CHF 251.00 in fiscal 2018/19 (grant date of 3 January 2019) and CHF 315.00 in fiscal \n 2017/18 (grant date of 3 January 2018).\n 2  Measured at the closing share price of CHF 217.00 at the date of determination of the number of shares granted, at the Board meeting of 29 \n November 2019.\n 3  Representing eight-twelfths of the shares granted under the LTIP, as the Board of Directors is compensated on the basis of the period from one \n Annual General Meeting to the next. \n 4  Chairman of the Nomination and Compensation Committee (NCC)\n 5  Member of the NCC\n 6  Chairman of the Risk and Audit Committee (RAC)\n 7  Member of the RAC\n \n No loans or other credit were granted to current or former members of the Board of Directors.

Their aggregate variable compensation for fiscal 2018/19 was CHF 494 \n thousand (prior year: CHF 625 thousand). This included equity compensation based on the market value of a total of 608 shares \n under the RSP (prior year: 520) at a share price of CHF 251.00 on 3 January 2019 (prior year: CHF 315.00). As well, a total of \n 973 shares were granted on 29 November 2019 for fiscal year 2018/19 under the new LTIP (prior year: not applicable) at a share \n price of CHF 217.00. No compensation was paid to former members of the Executive Committee.\n \n The aggregate total compensation of the Executive Committee for fiscal year 2018/19 was CHF 2,562 thousand (prior year:  \n CHF 2,376 thousand).

capital\n The issued share capital of Schaffner Holding AG consists of 635,940 ordinary registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 32.50 \n per share. The issued shares are fully paid. Each share carries one vote at the General Meeting. All shares not held by the Company \n or by one of its subsidiaries are entitled to dividends.  \n \n The Group’s legally required retained earnings and share premium totaled CHF 27.2 million at the balance sheet date (prior year: \n CHF 31.3 million). These reside in the holding company, Schaffner Holding AG.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 59\n \n Accounting policies \n \n Basis of preparation\n The consolidated financial statements comprise the individual financial statements of Schaffner Holding AG (the “Company”) and \n its subsidiaries (together, “Schaffner”, the “Group” or the “Schaffner Group”) as at 30 September 2018, drawn up in accordance \n with the uniform accounting policies of the Group. \n \n The consolidated financial statements comply with Swiss law and have been prepared in accordance with all existing guidelines of \n the Swiss Accounting and Reporting Recommendations (Swiss GAAP FER). Measurement is based on historical cost or on fair \n value. The measurement principles for the individual balance sheet items are given in the accounting policies described below. The \n presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is the Swiss franc.  \n \n With the aim of maximum transparency for readers of the financial statements, the Schaffner Group has decided to provide, in \n some areas, disclosures additional to those required by Swiss GAAP FER. In this way, Swiss GAAP FER serve as the foundation \n for the most transparent, easily understood and reader-friendly reporting possible.\n \n The consolidated financial statements are prepared in German and translated into English. The English version is provided solely \n for readers’ convenience. Only the German version is definitive and legally binding.\n \n Changes in accounting policies\n \n In the year under review there were no changes in the guidelines of the Swiss Accounting and Reporting Recommendations \n (Swiss GAAP FER).\n \n Assumptions and estimates\n The consolidated financial statements of the Schaffner Group contain assumptions and estimates which affect the reported financial \n position, results of operations and cash flows. These assumptions and estimates were made on the basis of management’s best \n knowledge at the time of preparation of the accounts. Actual results may differ from the values presented. \n \n Methods of consolidation\n The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Schaffner Holding AG and of its subsidiaries. Schaffner \n Holding AG and the subsidiaries are included by full consolidation. Under this method, these companies’ assets, liabilities, income \n and expenses are fully included in the consolidated financial statements.\n \n A subsidiary is a company over which Schaffner Holding AG directly or indirectly exercises control. \n \n All intra-Group balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation (both among the subsidiaries, and between them \n and Schaffner Holding AG). This also includes intra-Group profits on inventories and on non-current assets. \n \n Companies acquired during the reporting period are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of \n their acquisition. Companies divested during the reporting period remain included in the consolidated financial statements until \n the Group ceases to have control.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 60\n \n Translation of subsidiaries’ functional currencies into the Group’s presentation currency\n All assets and liabilities in the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries drawn up in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs (CHF) \n at period-end exchange rates (i.e., at closing rates for the reporting period). Expenses, income and cash flows are translated into \n Swiss francs at weighted average exchange rates for the reporting period, which approximate the actual transaction rates. Foreign \n exchange differences arising from the variation in applicable exchange rates are recognized directly in equity. \n \n Foreign currency transactions\n Foreign currency transactions of subsidiaries are translated into the functional currency of the subsidiary at exchange rates prevailing \n at the transaction date (i.e., at transaction rates). Their foreign currency balances are translated at period-end exchange rates. Gains \n and losses arising from the recovery, settlement or translation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are recognized as \n income or expense in the income statement.\n \n Intangible assets\n Intangible assets are stated at historical cost less amortization and impairment. Amortization is applied on a straight-line basis over \n the assets’ estimated useful life, which ranges from three to eight years.\n \n a) Acquisitions and goodwill\n Companies are consolidated from the date when control is acquired. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition \n method. The cost of an acquisition is calculated as the total consideration transferred, measured at fair value at the acquisition date. \n \n Any contingent consideration payable is recognized at the acquisition date at fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value of \n contingent consideration are recognized in the income statement. \n \n The difference between the purchase price and the remeasured net assets of the acquired company is referred to as goodwill. Any \n potential intangible assets obtained through an acquisition which were not previously recognized by the acquired company, such \n as trademarks, usage rights and customer lists, are not recognized separately but remain part of goodwill. Goodwill arising from \n acquisitions is offset against consolidated equity at the acquisition date. On disposal of part of a business, goodwill previously \n offset against equity must be transferred to the income statement. The impacts of a hypothetical capitalization and amortization \n of the goodwill are disclosed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \n b) Internally generated intangible assets\n Research and development costs for new products are fully recognized in the item “research and development expense” in the \n income statement.\n \n Development costs for software are capitalized as intangible assets, provided that the software will generate a future economic \n benefit through sale or internal use and that the cost can be reliably estimated. Additional conditions for capitalization are the \n technical feasibility of the asset, the intention and ability to complete its development, and the availability of sufficient resources \n for the purpose.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 61\n \n Property, plant and equipment\n Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment. They are depreciated on \n a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, which is as follows: \n \n Land\n Buildings\n Leasehold Improvements\n Machinery and equipment\n Furniture and fixtures\n Vehicles\n Information technology hardware\n Tools\n \n Not depreciated\n 25–50 years\n 5–10 years\n 5–10 years\n 5–10 years\n 3–6 years\n 3–5 years\n 1–5 years\n \n Leases under which a Group company as lessee has substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership are classified as finance leases. \n The leased asset is capitalized at the lower of its fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments, and a liability of the \n same amount is recognized in borrowings. The interest portion (the finance charge) of the lease payments is charged to the income \n statement. Payments made under operating leases are recognized as an expense in the income statement in equal installments over \n the life of the lease.\n \n Impairment of non-financial assets\n The recoverable amount of an asset is estimated whenever there is an indication of impairment. If the asset’s carrying amount exceeds \n the recoverable amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in the income statement. The recoverable amount is the \n higher of an asset’s net selling price and its value in use. An asset’s value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows \n from the asset.\n \n Inventories\n Products purchased for resale, and raw materials, are measured at the cost of purchase. Rebates received are deducted from purchase \n cost. Internally produced goods are measured at the cost of conversion, including an appropriate share of production overhead. \n Inventories in the balance sheet, and the charge to the income statement for the conversion cost of goods sold (cost of sales), are \n measured using the standard cost method. The standard costs are regularly reviewed and, when necessary, brought into line with \n current circumstances. Slow-moving inventories and those with a lower market value are written down. Unsaleable inventory is \n fully written off. Inventory is thus not measured at more than its net realizable value.\n \n Trade receivables\n The carrying amount (also known as carrying value) of trade receivables is their nominal value less a provision for doubtful debts, \n i.e., for impairment. Such write-downs are based on uniform rules under which impairment charges are provided individually for \n specific doubtful arrears. For those trade receivables on which impairment is not individually recognized, impairment is assessed \n collectively based on prior experience and the length of time overdue.\n \n Securities held as current assets\n Securities classified as current assets are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the income statement in \n finance income and expense. Where no fair value is known, they are measured at not more than cost less any impairment. Treasury \n shares are presented as a deduction from shareholders’ equity.\n \n Cash and cash equivalents\n Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand, bank deposits in postal and other bank accounts, bank drafts and short-term \n time deposits with residual maturities of up to 90 days.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 62\n \n Provisions\n Provisions are recognized when Schaffner has an obligation to a third party as a result of a past event, the amount of the obligation \n can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. If the outflow of \n resources is not probable or its amount cannot be determined, the obligation is reported in contingent liabilities. The amount \n of the provision is based on a best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation.\n \n Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the present value of the expected future expenditures. \n  \n Restructuring provisions are recognized if the costs attributable to a restructuring plan both can be determined reliably and \n represent a contractual obligation or a constructive obligation created by communication.\n \n Revenue recognition and interest income\n Net sales represent the revenue from goods sold and services rendered to third parties, net of discounts and other price reductions. \n Sales are recognized at the time that the benefits and risks of ownership of the products sold are transferred to the customer or the \n service is rendered; this timing depends on the agreed shipment terms (Incoterms).\n \n Revenue is recognized if an economic benefit is likely to accrue to the Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably determined. \n \n The sources of revenue of the Schaffner Group are detailed in note 14.\n \n Pension obligations\n The Schaffner Group operates a number of pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are generally financed \n by contributions from employees and the respective Group companies. \n \n The economic effects arising from the pension plans are assessed annually. Any plan surpluses or deficits are determined using the \n annual financial statements of the respective pension arrangements, which are based on Swiss GAAP FER 26 in the case of the \n Swiss plans, or on methods recognized in the respective other countries in the case of foreign plans. An economic benefit is recog-\n nized as an asset if it is permitted and intended to use the plan surplus toward the future pension costs of the Schaffner Group. \n Where there are freely disposable employer contribution reserves, these are also capitalized. An economic obligation is recognized \n as a liability if the requirements for raising a provision are met. Changes in the economic benefit or obligation are taken to the \n income statement and recognized in staff costs, as are the contributions payable for the reporting period.\n \n Segment reporting\n The Schaffner Group is organized into three divisions: EMC, Power Magnetics and Automotive. This delineation of segments \n (i.e., divisions) is consistent with the internal reporting on the basis of which the chief decision maker responsible allocates \n resources to these segments and evaluates their profitability. \n \n The Schaffner Group has identified its Executive Committee as this chief decision maker.\n \n Segment profit or loss represents a segment’s operating profit or loss before restructuring costs.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 63\n \n Income tax\n Accrued expenses for current income tax are recognized in the period in which the profits arise, on the basis of the reported \n profits. Tax is calculated in conformity with the tax laws applicable in the individual countries. \n \n Deferred tax is recognized using the liability method. Under this approach, the income tax effects of temporary differences between \n carrying amounts in the financial statements and their tax bases used in the calculation of taxable income are reported under non-\n current liabilities or non-current assets, using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period in which an asset is recovered or \n a liability settled. The change in deferred tax is recognized in the income statement. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated on all \n taxable temporary differences. \n \n Deferred tax assets, including assets for unused tax loss carry-forwards, are only recognized to the extent it is probable that future \n taxable profits will be available which will allow the assets to be utilized. The determination of the amount of deferred tax assets to \n be recognized involves assumptions and estimates by management as to the likely timing and amounts of future taxable profits. \n \n Borrowings\n Borrowings are recognized at their nominal amounts. Transaction costs incurred are recognized immediately in the income statement. \n Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has the unconditional right to postpone the settlement of the debt \n until at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.\n \n Share-based payments\n Until including fiscal year 2018/19, the award of shares under the Restricted Share Plan, which are subject to a three-year hold-\n ing period, was not tied to any vesting conditions. Therefore, there was no vesting period for these shares and the compensation \n was recognized in staff costs at the grant date. \n \n With effect from 1 October 2018, the Board of Directors created a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The fair value of the LTIP \n shares is measured at the quoted market price at the beginning of the vesting period (which starts at 1 October of the respective \n year), less a discount to compensate for the restricted status of the shares during the holding period. In setting the target number \n of shares, it is assumed that the target number will be multiplied by an achievement factor of 1. \n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 64\n \n Foreign currencies\n \n 1  \n In the consolidation of Group companies’ separate financial statements, the following exchange rates were applied in translating \n foreign-currency-denominated accounts into Swiss francs::\n \n Country or region\n China\n EU\n UK\n Hungary\n India\n Japan\n Sweden\n Singapore\n Thailand\n Taiwan\n USA\n \n Currency\n CNY 100\n 100\n EUR\n 100\n GBP\n HUF\n 100\n 100\n INR\n 100\n JPY\n SEK \n 100\n SGD 100\n THB\n 100\n TWD 100\n USD 100\n \n 2 \n \n Intangible assets  \n \n In CHF ’000\n Cost at 1 October 2017\n Additions\n Disposals \n Exchange differences\n Cost at 30 September 2018\n Additions\n Disposals\n Exchange differences\n Cost at 30 September 2019\n \n Accumulated amortization and impairment at 1 October 2017\n Amortization\n Disposals\n Exchange differences\n Accumulated amortization and impairment at 30 September 2018\n Amortization\n Disposals\n Exchange differences\n Accumulated amortization and impairment at 30 September 2019\n \n Net book value at 30 September 2018\n Net book value at 30 September 2019\n \n Balance sheet\n \n 30.09.2019\n In CHF\n 13.93\n 108.57\n 122.46\n 0.32\n 1.40\n 0.92\n 10.15\n 71.98\n 3.25\n 3.20\n 99.52\n \n 30.09.2018\n In CHF\n 14.20\n 113.15\n 127.43\n 0.35\n 1.35\n 0.86\n 10.98\n 71.40\n 3.02\n 3.20\n 97.70\n \n Technology  \n and rights\n 447\n \n – 5\n 442\n \n – 17\n 425\n \n – 430\n – 2\n \n 5\n – 427\n – 3\n \n 15\n – 415\n \n 15\n 10\n \n Income statement\n 2018/19\n In CHF\n 14.47\n 112.08\n 126.67\n 0.35\n 1.41\n 0.91\n 10.66\n 72.84\n 3.15\n 3.21\n 99.55\n \n Software\n \n 9,757\n 482\n – 30\n – 3\n 10,206\n 315\n – 189\n 4\n 10,336\n \n – 9,089\n – 321\n 26\n 7\n – 9,377\n – 353\n 189\n 2\n – 9,539\n \n 829\n 797\n \n 2017/18\n In CHF\n 14.90\n 116.01\n 131.29\n 0.37\n 1.46\n 0.88\n 11.42\n 72.57\n 3.02\n 3.26\n 97.47\n \n Total\n \n 10,204\n 482\n – 30\n – 8\n 10,648\n 315\n – 189\n – 13\n 10,761\n \n – 9,519\n – 323\n 26\n 12\n – 9,804\n – 356\n 189\n 17\n – 9,954\n \n 844\n 807\n \n In the consolidated income statement, amortization of intangible assets is included within “cost of sales”, “marketing and selling expense”, \n “research and development expense”, and “general and administrative expense”.

The hypothetical amortization is performed on a straight-line basis over a period of five years. \n \n A hypothetical capitalization of goodwill would have had the following impacts on the financial statements:\n \n In CHF ’000\n Cost at 1 October\n Exchange differences\n Cost at 30 September\n \n Accumulated amortization and impairment at 1 October\n Amortization\n Exchange differences\n Accumulated amortization and impairment at 30 September\n \n 2018/19\n 17,260\n 124\n 17,384\n \n – 16,600\n – 672\n – 112\n – 17,384\n \n 2017/18\n 17,196\n 64\n 17,260\n \n – 15,235\n – 1,317\n – 48\n – 16,600\n \n Hypothetical net book value at 30 September\n \n 0\n \n 660\n \n For fiscal year 2018/19, impairment testing of goodwill was no longer required, as its hypothetical net book value was zero. \n \n In the past, consistent with the internal organizational and reporting structure, impairment testing of the goodwill offset against equity \n was conducted on an operating segment basis. For the purposes of impairment testing, the segments were thus designated as the relevant \n cash-generating units (CGU). The impairment test was performed based on indications that goodwill items could potentially be im-\n paired. All of the Group’s goodwill was allocable to the Power Magnetics segment and was tested for impairment. The recoverable amount \n of this segment was its value in use, which was calculated from discounted future cash flows based on the business plan for the next five \n years. The projection relied both on prior experience and on management’s current judgment regarding the probable business trend in \n the relevant markets. An underlying assumption was that there would be no major organizational change. As the goodwill was already \n offset against equity at the acquisition date, an impairment of goodwill would not lead to a charge to income but merely to a disclosure \n in the notes.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 66\n \n 3  \n \n Property, plant and equipment\n \n In CHF ’000\n Cost at 1 October 2017\n Additions\n Disposals\n Reclassifications\n Exchange differences\n Cost at 30 September 2018\n Additions\n Disposals\n Reclassifications\n Exchange differences\n Cost at 30 September 2019\n \n Accumulated depreciation and  \n impairment at 1 October 2017\n Depreciation\n Disposals\n Impairment\n Reclassifications\n Exchange differences\n Accumulated depreciation and  \n impairment at 30 September 2018\n Depreciation\n Disposals\n Reclassifications\n Exchange differences\n Accumulated depreciation and  \n impairment at 30 September 2019\n \n Undeveloped \n land\n 177\n \n – 9\n 168\n \n – 12\n 156\n \n Land and  \n buildings\n 13,401\n 3,701\n – 1,875\n 308\n – 111\n 15,424\n 122\n – 411\n 202\n – 201\n 15,136\n \n – 8,124\n – 667\n 1,402\n \n – 27\n 20\n \n – 7,396\n – 624\n 285\n \n – 12\n \n Plant and \n machinery\n 47,001\n 2,299\n – 3,267\n 2,734\n 228\n 48,995\n 1,014\n – 1,193\n 3,274\n 1,215\n 53,305\n \n – 32,183\n – 3,249\n 2,228\n – 59\n 27\n – 78\n \n – 33,314\n – 3,347\n 864\n 1,266\n – 544\n \n IT hardware Other tangible \n assets\n 2,568\n 139\n – 309\n 27\n 5\n 2,430\n 1,051\n – 199\n 1,269\n 14\n 4,565\n \n 2,779\n 320\n – 194\n 31\n – 10\n 2,926\n 550\n – 186\n – 1\n – 35\n 3,254\n \n Assets under \n construction\n 1,988\n 4,908\n – 374\n – 3,100\n – 96\n 3,326\n 8,122\n – 185\n – 4,744\n 282\n 6,801\n \n 0\n \n 0\n \n – 2,340\n – 330\n 179\n \n – 2,179\n – 149\n 292\n \n 13\n \n – 6\n \n – 2,478\n – 234\n 181\n \n 35\n \n – 2,042\n – 171\n 195\n – 1,266\n – 9\n \n Total\n \n 67,914\n 11,367\n – 6,019\n 0\n 7\n 73,269\n 10,859\n – 2,175\n 0\n 1,263\n 83,217\n \n – 44,826\n – 4,395\n 4,101\n – 59\n 0\n – 51\n \n – 45,230\n – 4,376\n 1,525\n 0\n – 530\n \n – 7,747\n \n – 35,075\n \n – 2,496\n \n – 3,293\n \n 0\n \n – 48,611\n \n Net book value at 30 September 2018\n \n Of which finance leases\n \n Net book value at 30 September 2019\n \n Of which finance leases\n \n 168\n \n 156\n \n 8,028\n 2,000\n 7,388\n 1,813\n \n 15,681\n \n 18,230\n \n 448\n \n 758\n \n 388\n \n 1,272\n \n 3,326\n \n 6,801\n \n 28,039\n 2,000\n 34,605\n 1,813\n \n In the consolidated income statement, depreciation of property, plant and equipment is included within “cost of sales”, “marketing \n and selling expense”, “research and development expense”, and “general and administrative expense”. \n \n At the end of the fiscal year there were commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment in the amount of CHF 2.6 mil-\n lion (end of prior year: CHF 1.2 million).

Warranty pro-\n visions are measured based on historical experience regarding repairs and returns and adjusted to reflect current sales volumes. The \n outflows are expected to occur within the next three fiscal years.\n \n For specific warranty claims, additional provisions are created if the lump-sum provisions are either insufficient for these claims or \n are not intended for them.\n \n Pension provisions\n The pension provisions consist primarily of provisions for defined benefit plans in Germany, Thailand and France. \n \n Restructuring provisions\n In the prior fiscal year, restructuring provisions were created for further optimization measures in the Power Magnetics division in \n Europe. As of the end of fiscal 2018/19, these measures were largely completed. \n  \n Other provisions\n The utilization of CHF 0.6 million of “other provisions” was related in particular to a court case in France entailing customs risks.\n \n Borrowings\n \n 7 \n The average interest rate payable on borrowings in fiscal year 2018/19 was 2.2% (prior year: 1.9%).

These credit agreements are tied to covenants, which were fulfilled both during the year and at the balance sheet date. \n The contractual covenants relate to metrics that include net debt/EBITDA, equity, and equity ratios.\n \n The remaining maturities of the Group’s individual bank borrowings at the balance sheet date ranged up to three months. Under \n the credit agreements, they can be rolled over continuously until at least 30 June 2023.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 70\n \n Contingent liabilities and pledged assets \n \n 8 \n As a company with worldwide operations, Schaffner is exposed to numerous legal risks. The outcome of currently pending legal \n proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Provisions are established inasmuch as the financial consequences of a past event \n can be estimated reliably and the estimate can be confirmed by independent expert opinion. \n \n Assets of CHF 396 thousand (prior year: CHF 223 thousand) were pledged as collateral for electricity consumed and for pen-\n sion liabilities. \n \n  \n  9  Other operating income and expenses\n In the prior year, at the end of December 2017, the Schaffner Automotive division’s production plant in Thailand was heavily damaged \n by a fire. The ability to make deliveries to customers was maintained at all times in the prior year through effective crisis management \n and the rapid restoration of manufacturing capacity. \n \n Other operating income in the prior year included primarily the insurance benefits of CHF 4.1 million for the damaged and destroyed \n property, plant and equipment in connection with the fire in Thailand; other operating expenses reflected the net book values of these \n fixed assets of CHF 1.7 million.\n \n The other insured costs in the amount of approximately CHF 3.6 million related to the reconstruction were offset in the respective items \n of the income statement by business interruption insurance commitments and payments.\n \n 10 \n \n Staff costs \n \n In CHF ’000\n Wages and salaries\n Share-based payments expense (Long-Term Incentive Plan)1\n Share-based payments expense (Restricted Share Plan)1\n Social security costs\n Temporary employees and other staff costs\n Total staff costs\n 1  See note 15, page 77.

The pension fund of Schaffner’s Swiss companies is a private \n sector pension arrangement in the legal form of a foundation. It administers the delivery of Schaffner’s mandatory (legislated) and vol-\n untary post-employment benefits in Switzerland under the Swiss Federal Act on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability \n Pensions (the BVG). \n \n The top governing body of the pension fund of Schaffner’s Swiss companies is the foundation’s board of directors, made up of equal num-\n bers of employee and employer representatives. The benefits provided by the pension fund, their financing, the organization and admin-\n istration of the fund, the relationship to the sponsoring companies and to the plan participants (active employees and pension recipi-\n ents) are all specified in the regulations of the Schaffner Group’s Swiss pension fund. These regulations are issued by the foundation’s \n board of directors. \n \n The board may delegate the operational management to a management body. The foundation is under the oversight of the supervisory \n authority of the Canton of Solothurn.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 71\n \n Under the pension plan, employees and their survivors are insured against the economic consequences of old age, disability and death. \n The insured benefits exceed the legal requirements and are paid out as annuities or in lump sums. All insurance risks are fully reinsured. \n The pension plan is financed from contributions and investment returns. The sponsoring companies choose between two versions of sav-\n ings plan. Within the savings plan selected, the participants choose between a basic and a premium plan. The sponsoring companies and \n the participants pay the contributions to the pension fund based on a percentage of the participants’ insured pay. The amount of the con-\n tributions is calibrated so that the contributions and the expected return on the plan’s investments will safeguard the ability to pay the \n plan obligations (benefits).\n \n The foundation’s board of directors is responsible for the investment of the plan assets. The organization of the investing activities and \n the associated authority structure are set out in the investment regulations of the pension fund, which are issued by the board of the foun-\n dation. The investment regulations supplement the applicable legislative framework. They determine the asset allocation and set out the \n qualitative and quantitative guidelines for the individual asset classes. The plan assets are invested in such a way as to ensure capital pres-\n ervation and an appropriate return on capital, good diversification of risks, and cover of the foreseeable cash requirements. The founda-\n tion’s board of directors has delegated responsibility for the implementation of the investing activities to an investment committee. The \n investment activities of the Schaffner Group’s Swiss pension fund are performed by external providers (asset managers) and supervised \n by the investment committee. The plan assets are invested in accordance with legal requirements and the guidelines set by the founda-\n tion’s board and consist of a well-diversified portfolio of investments in Switzerland and other countries. The custodians are recognized \n Swiss banking institutions.\n \n The overall pension plan situation in the Group is as follows.\n \n Employer contribution reserve\n At 30 September 2019 there was no remaining employer contribution reserve (ECR, consisting of prepaid employer contributions for \n future periods). At the end of fiscal 2017/18 the Schaffner Group still held an ECR at its Swiss pension fund, in the amount of  \n CHF 15 thousand.

The contributions are recognized in staff costs.\n \n The pension fund of the Swiss companies of the Schaffner Group reported a surplus under FER 26.

The reason for the non-recognition is that it is considered unlikely the potential \n tax assets would be applied to taxable profits within the period allowed.

The weighted average applicable tax rate based on the subsidiaries’ results from or-\n dinary activities was 25.7% (prior year: 8.9%). \n \n The prior year’s effect of changes in tax rates resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in the United States in December 2017, \n which stipulated a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 2018, among other changes. Accordingly, the deferred tax assets for \n temporary differences for the US subsidiaries were measured at a new, lower rate. This increased the income tax expense for the \n prior year by CHF 2.7 million.\n \n At the balance sheet date the deferred tax liabilities and assets were attributable to items in the balance sheet as follows:\n \n In CHF ’000\n Intangible assets\n Property, plant and equipment\n Other non-current assets\n Inventories\n Trade receivables\n Provisions\n Trade and other payables\n Tax loss carryforwards\n Net deferred tax assets\n Of which:\n Reported in the balance sheet as deferred tax liabilities\n Reported in the balance sheet as deferred tax assets\n \n 2018/19\n 2,100\n – 855\n 0\n 1,889\n – 3\n 696\n 1,308\n 2,986\n 8,121\n \n – 510\n 8,632\n \n 2017/18\n 2,354\n – 755\n – 48\n 1,710\n 4\n 605\n 825\n 2,861\n 7,556\n \n – 475\n 8,032\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 75\n \n 14   Operating segments \n The Schaffner Group consists of three reportable segments: Electromagnetic Compatibility, Power Magnetics and Automotive. They are \n the organizational units for which results are reported to the Executive Committee.\n \n Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) \n The EMC division develops and manufactures standard and custom components that protect power electronic systems from line inter-\n ference (thus ensuring electromagnetic compatibility) and safeguard their reliable operation in power grids. As well, the division’s Power \n Quality business unit develops and manufactures active and passive filter solutions to assure the best quality of electric power. The key \n sales markets include energy-efficient drive systems, renewable energy, power supply systems for electronic devices, as well as machine \n tools and robotics.\n \n Power Magnetics (PM) \n The Power Magnetics division develops and manufactures components to ensure the reliable operation of power electronic systems, and \n builds customized high-performance transformers for demanding applications. Schaffner solutions deployed in solar inverters and con-\n verters in wind turbines safeguard high levels of energy conversion efficiency and assure optimum adaptation to electricity grids. Schaf-\n fner components are also integrated into compact, high-performance and energy-efficient locomotive drive systems, where they elimi-\n nate network interference from powerful motors.\n \n Automotive (AM)\n The Automotive division develops and manufactures components for keyless authentication systems and solutions for the drive trains of \n hybrid and electric vehicles. Working closely with leading automobile manufacturers and automotive suppliers, Schaffner engineers lev-\n erage their specialized EMC expertise to support customers in the development of new models.\n \n Corporate \n The “corporate” column comprises all costs for Group functions that cannot be allocated to a particular segment. These are primarily the \n expenses of Schaffner Holding AG.\n \n No operating segments have been aggregated to form these reportable operating segments.\n \n Segment profit or loss represents a segment’s operating profit or loss before restructuring costs.  \n \n The restructuring expenses of the Power Magnetics division consisted primarily of the costs in connection with further optimization meas-\n ures in Europe.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 76\n \n 2018/19\n In CHF ’000\n Net sales\n Segment profit/(–loss)\n Operating profit/(–loss) (EBIT)\n Net finance expense\n Profit before tax (EBT)\n Income tax\n Net profit for the period\n \n 2017/18\n In CHF ’000\n Net sales\n Segment profit/(–loss)\n Restructuring-related expenses\n Operating profit/(–loss) (EBIT)\n Net finance expense\n Profit before tax (EBT)\n Income tax\n Net profit for the period\n \n EMC\n \n 106,923\n 15,165\n 15,165\n \n EMC\n \n 115,895\n 17,788\n \n 17,788\n \n PM\n \n 51,952\n – 3,311\n – 3,311\n \n PM\n \n 56,604\n – 5,504\n – 1,278\n – 6,782\n \n AM\n \n Corporate\n \n Group\n \n 38,512\n 2,548\n 2,548\n \n – 4,599\n – 4,599\n \n 197,387\n 9,803\n 9,803\n – 1,765\n 8,039\n – 832\n 7,207\n \n AM\n \n Corporate\n \n Group\n \n 49,022\n 11,303\n \n 11,303\n \n – 5,151\n \n – 5,151\n \n 221,521\n 18,436\n – 1,278\n 17,158\n – 2,106\n 15,052\n – 5,660\n 9,392\n \n Information by region\n In the analysis below, net sales with external customers are attributed to regions based on customer location. \n \n 2018/19\n In CHF ’000\n Net external sales\n \n 2017/18\n In CHF ’000\n Net external sales\n \n Europe\n 92,072\n \n Europe\n 99,999\n \n Asia\n 63,284\n \n Asia\n 77,299\n \n Americas\n 42,030\n \n Group\n 197,387\n \n Americas\n 44,223\n \n Group\n 221,521\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 77\n \n 15   Share-based payments\n The Schaffner Group maintains several equity incentive plans (share ownership plans) for upper management employees and the \n Board of Directors. These are option-based plans (ESOP) and share-based plans (RSP/LTIP).\n \n In fiscal year 2012/13 the Board of Directors decided to replace the Employee Share Option Plan for upper management employ-\n ees and Board members (ESOP) with a share-based plan. As a result, no new options have been issued since including fiscal year \n 2012/13. The last issued options expired in the fiscal year under review.\n \n Option-based incentive plans  \n From 1 October 1998 on, the Group granted options over ordinary registered shares of Schaffner Holding AG to upper manage-\n ment employees and to members of the Board of Directors. The basis for the awards of such options was the Schaffner Holding \n AG Employee Share Option Plan 1998 (ESOP). The shares required to satisfy the obligations under the ESOP were drawn  \n (i) from authorized unissued share capital of Schaffner Holding AG and (ii) from treasury shares.   \n \n Share options under the ESOP ordinarily vested in four annual installments of 25%, beginning one year after the grant date. Four \n years after the grant date, all granted options were thus ordinarily vested. Unexercised options expired seven years after the grant \n date.\n \n Share options were granted for the last time on 21 November 2011. \n \n At 1 October\n Granted in the year\n Exercised in the year\n Expired/canceled in the year\n At 30 September\n Of which:\n Vested\n Uncovered\n \n 30.09.2019\n \n Number of share \n options outstanding\n \n 740\n 0\n 0\n – 740\n 0\n \n 0\n 0\n \n Average   \n exercise price  \n in CHF \n 235\n \n 0\n 235\n 0\n \n 0\n \n 30.09.2018\n \n Number of share \n options outstanding\n \n 4,060\n 0\n – 3,320\n 0\n 740\n \n 740\n 0\n \n Average   \n exercise price  \n in CHF \n 236\n \n 236\n \n 235\n \n 235\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 78\n \n The terms of the share options outstanding at the end of the fiscal year were as follows:\n \n 30.09.2019\n \n Number of  \n share options  \n outstanding \n \n Exercise price  \n in CHF \n \n 30.09.2018\n \n Number of  \n share options  \n outstanding \n \n Expiry date\n 21.11.2018\n Total\n In the year under review no expense for share option plans was recognized in the income statement.\n \n 235.00\n \n 0\n 0\n \n 740\n 740\n \n Exercise price  \n in CHF \n \n 235.00\n \n Share-based incentive plans\n \n Restricted Share Plan\n Until recently, upper management employees and the members of the Board of Directors were annually granted shares under the \n Restricted Share Plan. The final grants under this plan were made on 3 January 2019 for fiscal year 2017/18. The shares are subject \n to a three-year holding period, during which they carry full voting and dividend rights. If the recipient leaves the company during \n the holding period, the shares do not revert to the company, but remain subject to the holding period.\n \n In 2018/19, a total of 2,097 shares (prior year: 2,288 shares) with a fair value of CHF 211 per share were granted (prior year:  \n CHF 264). The expense of CHF 442 thousand (prior year: CHF 605 thousand) was recognized in the same fiscal year. \n \n Long-Term Incentive Plan\n Effective 1 October 2018, the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) was replaced with a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The members \n of the Board of Directors and selected key personnel of the company are each allocated a contractually agreed target number of \n shares. This target number of shares is multiplied by an achievement factor between 0.5 and 1.5 that is set by the Board.\n \n The shares are subject to a holding period of at least three years, during which they carry full voting and dividend rights. If the re-\n cipient leaves the company during the holding period, the shares do not revert to the company, but remain subject to the holding \n period.\n \n For the fiscal year under review, based on the assumption of an achievement factor of 1, a total target number of 2,145 shares was \n allocated under the LTIP and recognized as an expense. The fair value of CHF 258.17 per share was expensed in the fiscal year at \n a total amount of CHF 513 thousand. The actual, final number of shares to be granted was to be determined by the Board of Di-\n rectors after the reporting period, on 29 November 2019.\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 79\n \n 16   Earnings per share\n \n Basic earnings per share\n Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to shareholders of Schaffner Holding AG \n by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period, excluding ordinary shares purchased by \n the Group and held as treasury shares.\n \n Basic earnings per share\n Net profit for the period in CHF ’000\n Weighted average number of shares outstanding entitled to dividend\n Basic earnings per share in CHF\n \n 2018/19\n \n 2017/18\n \n 7,207\n 634,231\n 11.36\n \n 9,392\n 634,326\n 14.81\n \n Diluted earnings per share\n Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to shareholders of Schaffner Holding \n AG by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period, including all shares that would result \n from the exercise of any potentially dilutive outstanding share options.\n \n Diluted earnings per share\n Net profit for the period in CHF ’000\n Relevant share options outstanding, in number of shares\n Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculation of diluted earnings per share\n Diluted earnings per share in CHF\n \n 17 \n \n Treasury shares\n \n At 1 October 2017\n + Purchase1\n – Shares utilized for restricted share plans2\n Valuation differences3\n \n At 30 September 2018\n + Purchase1\n – Shares utilized for restricted share plans2\n Valuation differences3\n \n Number of shares\n \n 1,004\n 3,298\n – 2,288\n \n 2,014\n 3,466\n – 2,097\n \n At 30 September 2019\n 1  At share prices quoted at the transaction date.\n 2  At fair value.\n 3  The difference between the average purchase price and the exercise price or selling price is taken to share premium.\n \n 3,383\n \n 2018/19\n \n 2017/18\n \n 7,207\n 0\n 634,231\n 11.36\n \n 9,392\n 191\n 634,517\n 14.80\n \n Average share \n price in CHF\n 298\n \n At average price in \n CHF '000\n 299\n 1,053\n – 605\n – 110\n \n 316\n \n 236\n \n 637\n 829\n – 442\n – 224\n \n 800\n \n \fNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n \n 80\n \n 18  Related parties\n All transactions with subsidiaries were completely eliminated on consolidation.\n \n Information on the amounts of compensation of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee is provided in the compensa-\n tion report from page 46.\n \n 19  Release of the consolidated financial statements for publication\n The consolidated financial statements were released by the Board of Directors of Schaffner Holding AG on 29 November 2019 for \n publication and will be presented to shareholders for adoption at the Annual General Meeting on 14 January 2020.\n \n 20   Events after the balance sheet date\n No events have occurred after the balance sheet date that have a material effect on the amounts in the consolidated financial statements.\n \n 21  Companies of the Schaffner Group\n The following companies’ results were consolidated in the accounts of the Schaffner Group at 30 September 2019:\n \n Company\n Schaffner Holding AG\n \n Schaffner International AG\n Schaffner EMV AG\n \n Schaffner Oy\n Schaffner EMC S.A.S.\n Schaffner Ltd.\n Schaffner EMV Hungary Kft.\n Schaffner EMC S.r.l.\n Schaffner Deutschland GmbH\n Schaffner PM Services GmbH\n Schaffner EMC AB\n Schaffner EMC, Inc.\n Schaffner MTC LLC\n \n Schaffner EMC Ltd.\n Schaffner EMC K.K.\n Schaffner EMC Pte.

Our responsibilities under those provisions \n and standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements sec-\n tion of our report. \n \n Bericht zur Prüfung\n der Konzernrechnung 2016/2017\n \n We are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession \n and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. \n \n We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \n \n (umfassend die Zeitperiode vom 1.10.2016 - 30.9.2017)\n \n Report on Key Audit Matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority \n Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated \n financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial \n statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. \n \n \fReport of the statutory auditor \n on the consolidated financial statements\n \n 82\n \n Key Audit Matter\n \n How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n \n  \n \n Valuation of the production facilities of the Power  \n Magnetics (PM) segment   \n The reporting for the PM segment shows loss of approximately \n CHF 3.3 million for the fiscal year 2018/19. For this reason, \n the production facilities assigned to this segment were tested \n for any impairment.  \n \n Whether these assets maintain their value depends on the \n achievement of sufficient future cash inflows. \n \n We treated the assessment of the valuation of the production \n facilities in the PM segment as a key audit matter for two rea-\n sons: \n \n First, the share of the production facilities assigned to this seg-\n ment is material. Second, significant management judgments \n are involved in arriving at assumptions in connection with fu-\n ture segment results and with discount rates applied to fore-\n cast cash flows. \n \n The Group’s disclosures on the production facilities and on \n the reporting segments are included in notes 3 and 14 to the \n consolidated financial statements. \n \n Valuation of deferred tax assets \n Deferred tax assets of CHF 8.6 million are recognized in the \n consolidated financial statements. Details on their composi-\n tion and origin are included in note 13 to the consolidated fi-\n nancial statements.  \n \n The realization of these potential future tax savings depends on \n the achievement of sufficient taxable income. \n \n This item is large in amount and, in our view, was of particular \n significance in the audit, as the underlying projections are to a \n high degree based on management’s estimates and assumptions.\n \n An die Generalversammlung der\n \n We received the valuation records related to the impairment \n testing prepared by the Group. By additional discussions with \n management, we obtained an understanding of the manner \n in which management arrived at the valuations. \n \n Schaffner Holding AG\n Nordstrasse11\n Specifically, we assessed whether the use of the discounted \n 4542 Luterbach\n cash flow (DCF) model is appropriate. We also tested math-\n ematical accuracy, as well as the attainability of the underly-\n ing projections.

Reasonable assur-\n ance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing \n Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \n material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken \n on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. \n \n An die Generalversammlung der\n \n A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located at the website of  \n EXPERTsuisse: http://expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report-for-public-companies. \n This description forms part of our auditor’s report. \n \n Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements \n In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system \n exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board \n of Directors. \n \n Bericht zur Prüfung\n der Konzernrechnung 2016/2017\n \n We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved. \n \n Solothurn, 29 November 2019 \n \n BDO Ltd\n \n Beat Rüfenacht \n  \n Auditor in Charge  \n Licensed Audit Expert\n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n Christoph Tschumi\n Licensed Audit Expert\n \n (umfassend die Zeitperiode vom 1.10.2016 - 30.9.2017)\n \n \fCompany financial statements of Schaffner Holding AG\n \n 84\n \n Balance sheet \n \n In CHF '000\n Cash and cash equivalents, and current assets with a quoted market price\n Other current receivables\n Prepaid expenses and deferred income\n Current assets\n \n Non-current receivables\n Investments in subsidiaries\n Non-current assets\n \n TOTAL ASSETS\n \n Current interest-bearing liabilities\n Other current payables\n Accrued expenses\n Current liabilities\n Non-current provisions\n Non-current liabilities\n \n Total liabilities\n \n Share capital\n Legally required capital reserves\n – Share premium\n Legally required retained earnings\n – General legally required retained earnings\n Discretionary retained earnings\n – Earnings brought forward\n – Net profit for the year\n Treasury shares\n Shareholders' equity\n \n TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\n \n Income statement\n (year ended 30 September)\n \n In CHF '000\n Operating income\n Net sales of services\n Staff costs\n Other operating expenses\n Operating profit before interest and tax (EBIT)\n Finance income\n Finance expense\n Profit before tax (EBT)\n Direct tax\n Net profit for the year\n \n Note\n 2.1\n 2.2\n \n 2.3\n 2.4\n \n 2.5\n 2.6\n 2.7\n \n 2.8\n \n 1.1\n \n 2.9\n \n 5.1\n \n Note\n 3.1\n \n 3.2\n \n 3.3\n 3.4\n \n 30.09.2019\n 43\n 4,526\n 0\n 4,569\n \n 30.09.2018\n 99\n 3,620\n 62\n 3,781\n \n 1,845\n 85,251\n 87,096\n \n 91,665\n \n 3,656\n 13,654\n 464\n 17,774\n 7\n 7\n \n 17,781\n \n 20,668\n \n 23,081\n \n 4,134\n \n 25,120\n 1,681\n – 800\n 73,885\n \n 91,665\n \n 2018/19\n 5,693\n 5,693\n – 2,289\n – 1,839\n 1,565\n 455\n – 174\n 1,846\n – 164\n 1,681\n \n 0\n 85,251\n 85,251\n \n 89,032\n \n 4,200\n 7,492\n 838\n 12,530\n 7\n 7\n \n 12,537\n \n 20,668\n \n 27,210\n \n 4,134\n \n 23,041\n 2,079\n – 637\n 76,495\n \n 89,032\n \n 2017/18\n 7,157\n 7,157\n – 2,938\n – 2,076\n 2,143\n 179\n – 37\n 2,285\n – 206\n 2,079\n \n \fNotes to the company financial statements \n of Schaffner Holding AG\n \n 85\n \n 1     Background information and basis of preparation \n \n 1.1  General information\n \n Legal form, registered office and share capital \n Schaffner Holding AG (“the Company”) was founded as a stock corporation in Switzerland and has its registered office in Luterbach \n in the canton of Solothurn. Its share capital is CHF 20,668,050, consisting of 635,940 registered shares with a nominal value of CHF \n 32.50 per share. The issued shares are fully paid.\n \n Purpose of the Company\n The Company’s purpose is the acquisition and management of equity interests in commercial, financial and industrial enterprises \n in Switzerland and abroad, and the purchase and sale of any types of securities, movable assets and real property.\n \n Average full-time equivalents in the year\n Schaffner Holding AG did not employ more than 50 full-time equivalents on average over the year (prior year: not more than 50). \n \n Level of audit\n The audit of Schaffner Holding AG by the audit firm is an ordinary audit, as the conditions under section 727 et seq. of the Swiss \n Code of Obligations for this highest level of audit assurance are met. \n \n 1.2  Accounting policies\n \n Accounting principles\n These company financial statements were prepared in accordance with the principles of the applicable Swiss Accounting Law \n (Title 32 of the Swiss Code of Obligations). Those key accounting principles that are not prescribed by law are set out below. \n \n Omission of management report, cash flow statement and supplementary disclosures in the notes\n As Schaffner Holding AG prepares consolidated financial statements under a recognized accounting standard (Swiss GAAP FER), it \n has elected in these company financial statements, as permitted by law, to dispense with preparing a management report and to omit \n a cash flow statement and (in the notes) to omit the supplementary information on interest-bearing liabilities and accounting fees. \n  \n Estimates and assumptions by management\n The accounting in accordance with the Swiss Code of Obligations requires certain assumptions and estimates by management. These \n judgments are made on an ongoing basis and take into consideration past experience and other factors (such as expectations of future \n events that seem reasonable under the circumstances). The actual subsequent outcomes may differ from these assumptions and esti-\n mates. It should be borne in mind that hidden reserves may be created and released to safeguard the sustained success of the Company. \n \n Related parties\n Related parties include the subsidiaries, the members of the Board of Directors and the shareholders of the Company. Transactions \n with related parties are conducted at arm’s length.\n \n Cash and cash equivalents, and current assets with a quoted market price\n The item “cash and cash equivalents, and current assets with a quoted market price” consists of cash on hand, bank deposits, and \n short-term money market investments with a term to maturity of up to three months. Securities held as current assets are measured \n at the quoted market price at the balance sheet date. No revaluation reserve is maintained.\n \n \fNotes to the company financial statements \n of Schaffner Holding AG\n \n 86\n \n Other current receivables and payables\n Other current receivables and payables consist primarily of the intra-Group pass-throughs to and from the subsidiaries. These assets \n and liabilities are recognized at their nominal value.\n \n Treasury shares\n Treasury shares are measured at cost at the time of acquisition and are recognized as a deduction item in equity. On subsequent resale, \n the gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as finance income or expense. The subsidiaries do not hold treasury shares of \n Schaffner Holding AG.\n \n Operating income\n Operating income consists of income from subsidiaries and intra-Group income from licenses and management fees.\n \n Share-based payments\n Upper management employees and the members of the Board of Directors are annually granted restricted shares. The shares are sub-\n ject to a three-year holding period, during which they carry full voting and dividend rights. If the recipient leaves the company during \n the holding period, the shares do not revert to the company, but remain subject to the holding period. \n \n 2     Notes to the balance sheet\n \n 2.1  Cash and cash equivalents, and current assets with a quoted market price\n \n In CHF '000\n Bank deposits\n Total\n \n 2.2  Other current receivables\n \n In CHF '000\n Other receivables from non-Group entities\n Other receivables from subsidiaries\n Total\n \n 2.3  Non-current receivables\n \n In CHF '000\n Non-current receivables from subsidiaries\n Total\n \n 30.09.2019\n 43\n 43\n \n 30.09.2018\n 99\n 99\n \n 30.09.2019\n 25\n 4,501\n 4,526\n \n 30.09.2018\n 33\n 3,587\n 3,620\n \n 30.09.2019\n 1,845\n 1,845\n \n 30.09.2018\n 0\n 0\n \n \fNotes to the company financial statements  \n of Schaffner Holding AG\n \n 87\n \n 2.4 \n \n Investments in subsidiaries\n \n Directly held\n \n In CHF ’000, except % \n Schaffner EMV AG\n Luterbach, Switzerland\n Schaffner International AG\n Luterbach, Switzerland\n Schaffner EMV Hungary Kft.\n Kecskemét, Hungary\n \n Indirectly held\n \n In CHF ’000, except % \n Schaffner Oy\n Lohja, Finland\n Schaffner EMC S.A.S.\n Illzach, France\n Schaffner Ltd.\n Wokingham, United Kingdom\n Schaffner EMV Hungary Kft.\n Kecskemét, Hungary\n Schaffner EMC S.r.l.\n Milan, Italy\n Schaffner EMC AB\n Sollentuna, Sweden\n Schaffner EMC Inc.\n Edison, NJ, USA\n Schaffner MTC LLC\n Wytheville, VA, USA\n Schaffner EMC Ltd.\n Shanghai, China\n Schaffner EMC K.K.\n Tokyo, Japan\n Schaffner EMC Pte.

Our responsibilities under those provisions \n and standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our re-\n port.\n \n We are independent of the entity in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession \n and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n \n Bericht zur Prüfung\n der Konzernrechnung 2016/2017\n \n We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n \n Report on Key Audit Matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority\n Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial state-\n ments of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in \n forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n \n (umfassend die Zeitperiode vom 1.10.2016 - 30.9.2017)\n \n \fReport of the statutory auditor \n on the company financial statements\n \n 94\n \n Key Audit Matter\n \n How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n \n Valuation of investments in subsidiaries\n At 30 September 2019 the financial statements show invest-\n ments in subsidiaries totalling CHF 85.3 million. Invest-\n ments in subsidiaries are recognized at historical cost less \n any adjustments for impairments. At 30 September 2019, \n no impairment was recognized.\n \n In our view this item, which is very large in amount, was of \n particular significance, as management’s valuation method \n for evaluating the need for impairment charges involves a \n high degree of management judgment.\n \n The company’s disclosures on investments in subsidiaries are \n included in note 2.4 to the financial statements.\n \n By inspecting the valuation records and discussions with man-\n agement, we obtained an understanding of how management \n determines the need for impairment charges.\n \n An die Generalversammlung der\n \n Specifically, we evaluated whether management’s valuation of \n Schaffner Holding AG\n the investments in subsidiaries as a group of assets is appro-\n Nordstrasse11\n priate when taking into account intra-group linkages and \n 4542 Luterbach\n whether the carrying amount is reasonable in relation to the \n market capitalization of the Schaffner Group.\n \n Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements\n The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss \n law and the company’s articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to \n enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n \n Bericht zur Prüfung\n der Konzernrechnung 2016/2017\n \n In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the entity’s ability to continue as a going \n concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the \n Board of Directors either\n \n Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material mis-\n statement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a \n high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards \n will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material \n if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the \n basis of these financial statements.\n \n (umfassend die Zeitperiode vom 1.10.2016 - 30.9.2017)\n \n A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the website of EXPERTsuisse: \n http://expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report-for-public-companies.
