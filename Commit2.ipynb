strong growth for the Group, with bakery output \n doubling on a 53.5% increase in Food Group revenue, largely as a result of the  \n acquisitions completed just one year ago. These acquisitions (Fresh Start Bakeries, Great \n Kitchens and Maidstone Bakeries) significantly enhanced the diversification of our \n customer base, our market channels, our products and our geographic footprint. The \n combined acquisition investment was approximately €1.4 billion, which added 30 \n additional production locations in nine countries. These newly acquired businesses \n performed to expectation.\n \n Our underlying Food business witnessed a return to modest positive revenue growth of \n 2.7%, while margins expanded in our Food business by 20bps to 12.5%. This was \n achieved in a very challenging trading environment of weak consumer spending, higher \n taxation and prices, and continuing volatility surrounding currency and commodities and \n credit availability. The 2011 outturn reflects the underlying strength of ARYZTA’s  \n diversified markets, customers and products. It also reflects the well developed financial \n disciplines in managing cash generation and debt levels which underpin the Group’s \n ability to continue to invest behind the business, while maintaining investment grade \n status.\n \n The enhanced diversification arising from these acquisitions represents an important \n milestone for our shareholders in delivering ARYZTA’s target to ‘double the earnings base \n within five years from June 2008’. Additionally it positions the Group to expand into \n emerging markets.  \n \n During the year, input costs persistently increased. While the extent of input price \n inflation was large and triggered price increases to protect margins, ARYZTA is working \n closely with its customers to mitigate the impact of pricing on the consumer through \n product innovation, product selection and service model efficiencies. \n \n The year under review also marked the second phase of the ARYZTA Transformation \n Initiative (‘ATI’). Over the past number of years, extensive preparation and planning has \n been completed to integrate the Group’s global operations into a more cohesive entity, \n delivering improved performances and a more customer centric business. ATI remains a \n critical area of investment for ARYZTA in the years ahead, as well as a substantial  \n enabler to the delivery of targets. \n \n Results\n ARYZTA’s financial year was a challenging one. Trading conditions were difficult, with the \n onset of persistent input price inflation and the subdued consumer spending environ-\n ment. However, the Group performed well, reporting modest underlying growth in most \n markets over the period. Pricing action preserved margins and ARYZTA continued to work \n hard with its retail and foodservice partners to provide freshly baked and conveniently \n prepared, high-quality baked goods at affordable prices.\n \n Against this backdrop, the Group posted a strong earnings performance for the financial \n year 2011, increasing underlying fully diluted earnings per share by 27.1% to 310.1 cent, \n which represents an underlying fully diluted net profit of €260 million in the period.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 4\n \n Letter to Shareholders (continued)\n \n Dividend\n The Board recommends a final dividend of CHF 0.56791 per share, to be paid on \n 1 February 2012, if approved at the General Meeting on 1 December 2011.\n \n Board membership\n At the 2010 AGM, the term of office for Albert Abderhalden, Noreen Hynes, Hugo Kane \n and Owen Killian was due to expire. Albert, Noreen and Hugo, having served on the \n Board of Directors since 22 August 2008, did not seek re-election and we take the \n opportunity to thank them and pay tribute to their service to ARYZTA as members of  \n the Board of Directors. \n \n Owen Killian was re-elected to the Board at the 2010 AGM for a term of three years.  \n A new Board member, Charles Adair, was elected to the Board of Directors for a three  \n year term. Details of Charles’s biography are available on page 32 in the Corporate \n Governance report.\n \n The Board of ARYZTA AG now consists of two executive directors and seven non- \n executive directors. This number is in keeping with the intention to reduce the size of the \n Board, as outlined in the Company Prospectus of ARYZTA AG dated 11 July 2008.\n \n Acknowledgement\n On behalf of the Board, we would like to acknowledge the talent, hard work and commitment \n of ARYZTA’s management and staff. This is an everyday business and our people are  \n the inspiration to excellence every day. We would also like to thank our customers for \n their support and loyalty, and our suppliers for their reliability at all times. \n \n We believe ARYZTA AG is well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth.\n \n Denis Lucey \n Chairman, Board of Directors \n \n Owen Killian\n CEO, Member of the Board of Directors\n \n 22 September 2011\n \n 1  Based on EUR 0.4652 per share converted at the foreign exchange rate of one euro to CHF 1.22082  \n \n on 22 September 2011, the date of approval of the ARYZTA financial statements. \n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 5\n \n Food euroPe\n FrAnce\n Paris\n Parc de Belleville\n \n ARYZTA has 12 distribution centres operating \n across France.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 6\n \n Annual Report and Accounts 2011\n Business Overview\n About ARYZTA\n \n ARYZTA AG (‘ARYZTA’) is a global food business with a leadership position in speciality \n bakery.

Speciality bakery consists of freshly prepared offerings \n giving the best value, variety, taste and convenience to consumers at the point of sale. \n ARYZTA’s customers are an evenly balanced mix of convenience and independent retail, \n large retail, limited serve restaurants (‘LSR’) and other foodservice categories.\n \n Total revenue growth in the Food Group business was underpinned by the strategic\n acquisitions made in the previous financial year and at the start of this financial year. \n Total Food Group revenue grew by 53.5% to €2.6bn, with acquisitions performing  \n to expectations, contributing 48.8%. \n \n ARYZTA’s underlying food business performed strongly, posting revenue growth of 2.7% \n in what was a very challenging trading environment. Food EBITA margins expanded by \n 20bps to 12.5%, reflecting the combination of improved efficiencies, a return of modest \n underlying growth in the year and changes in product mix.\n \n The return of underlying revenue growth during the financial year was evident across \n most markets, particularly post Q1, with the exception of Ireland and the UK. The \n performance in North America was particularly strong, reflecting the increased focus  \n on the LSR channel, which enjoyed strong growth in the period. Despite the positive \n outcome, the operating environment remains challenging, with primary food inflation and \n recently renewed uncertainty surrounding the global economy, combined with  \n persistently high unemployment and the threat of rising taxation in many countries, \n denting consumer confidence.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 14\n \n Financial and Business Review (continued)\n \n Food Europe\n \n 6 \n Food Europe has leading market positions in the European speciality bakery market. It \n has a diversified customer base including convenience retail, gas stations, multiple retail,\n restaurants, catering and hotels, leisure and LSRs. Food Europe revenue grew by 10.5% \n to €1.18bn, with acquisition contribution of 7.1% and underlying revenue growth of 0.9%. \n Food Europe’s EBITA grew 13.6% to €149.0m. Food Europe EBITA margin improved \n strongly by 40bps to 12.6% in the period.\n \n Throughout the year, continental European markets were the key growth drivers. Market \n conditions in the UK and Ireland remained challenging, with weak consumer demand  \n still evident. However, substantial progress has been made through operating efficiencies \n and cost curtailment initiatives thereby allowing operators to increase their value \n offerings.\n \n Food North America\n \n 7 \n Food North America is a leading player in the US bakery speciality market. It has a \n diversified customer base, including multiple retail, restaurants, catering and hotels, \n leisure, hospitals, military, fundraising and LSRs.\n \n Food North America revenue grew by 112% to €1.21bn, with acquisition contribution  \n of 107% and underlying revenue growth of 5.3%. Food North America’s EBITA grew \n 113% to €148.7m. Food North America also posted a positive EBITA margin expansion  \n of 10bps to 12.3%, reflecting ongoing initiatives to expand revenues and improve \n operating efficiencies.\n \n During FY 2011, the integration of Otis and Pennant into a single sweet bakery operation  \n was completed and by year end approximately 80% of ARYZTA’s North American  \n food business was operating live on Enterprise Resource Planning (‘ERP’). ARYZTA’s \n Food North America operations enjoy very strong customer relationships across all  \n channels, such that the impact of channel switching by consumers is minimised. Food \n North America posted a very strong performance in the enlarged LSR channel, which \n enjoyed stable consumption volumes of bakery goods during the period, while businesses \n serving channels in higher income regions also posted strong revenue growth.\n \n Food Rest of World \n \n 8 \n ARYZTA has businesses in Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Japan as well as \n a joint venture production facility in Guatemala.\n \n Food Rest of World revenue grew by 403% to €180.0m, with acquisition contribution\n of 374% and strong underlying revenue growth of 17.0%. Food Rest of World’s EBITA\n grew 313% to €24.6m. While EBITA margin declined in the period to 13.7% from 16.6%\n in the prior year due to the impact of the Japanese natural disaster in Q3, ARYZTA’s\n Japanese business recovered well in Q4. The development of a new bakery in Brazil is on \n track to satisfy the continuing strong volume growth in this market.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 15\n \n Financial and Business Review (continued)\n \n Acquisition Update\n \n 9 \n ARYZTA has committed €100m investment to a number of bolt-on acquisitions in Asia \n and the UK. The Food Group expects to close the acquisition of two bakeries in Taiwan \n and Singapore in Q1 2012. The decision to acquire these bakeries was previously \n announced in August 2010. ARYZTA has also closed the acquisition of a UK  \n manufacturer of flat breads which primarily services the UK retail channel. These \n acquisitions are aligned with the Food Group’s strategy to diversify geographies, channels \n and products. These acquisitions are expected to add approximately €78m in revenue  \n in FY 2012 and to be modestly earnings accretive. ARYZTA has also committed to \n construct a new bakery in Malaysia instead of proceeding with the previously announced \n plan to acquire a bakery in Malaysia in August 2010.\n \n Food Group Non-Recurring Items & Strategic Repositioning\n \n 10 \n Arising from ARYZTA’s strategic repositioning initiatives across its Food Europe and Food \n North America businesses, ARYZTA has incurred non-recurring costs in the period. The \n impact of these together with the fair value gain on the acquisition of Maidstone Bakeries \n (‘Maidstone’) in October 2010, have resulted in a net benefit of €0.98m in the financial \n year to the end of July 2011. These break down as follows:\n \n Strategic repositioning costs for financial year ending 31 July 2011\n \n in Euro `000\n Maidstone fair value gain on existing 50% at acquisition\n Asset write-down arising on integration\n Costs arising on integration\n Transaction costs (including share purchase tax)\n \n Non-Cash\n 121,391\n (43,039)\n (3,600)\n –\n \n Cash\n –\n –\n (63,092)\n (10,686)\n \n Total\n 121,391\n (43,039)\n (66,692)\n (10,686)\n \n Asset write-down costs relate to the closure of six sites. The costs were split 44% in  \n H1 and 56% in H2, with two sites closed in H1. The reporting segment splits for asset \n write-down costs were 81% in Food Europe and 19% in Food North America. \n \n Approximately 96% or €60.3m of cash costs arising on integration resulted from staff \n severance, site decommissioning and advisory costs. Approximately 62% of these costs \n related to Food North America.\n \n ARYZTA Transformation Initiative \n \n 11 \n Following on from the phased implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (‘ERP’)\n throughout the business in FY 2010 and FY 2011, the ARYZTA Transformation Initiative \n (‘ATI’) will now enter an accelerated phase of implementation in FY 2012. At year end  \n FY 2011 approximately 40% of ARYZTA’s Group wide businesses were operating live on \n ERP (80% in Food North America). ARYZTA is developing two integrated platforms in \n Europe and North America operating on a single ERP system.\n \n ATI’s goal is to develop enhanced customer interaction through the development of a\n single sales contact network for the entire product offering. It is also standardising  \n operational processes, manufacturing, data and performance measurement and financial \n controls.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 16\n \n Financial and Business Review (continued)\n \n ARYZTA views ATI as key to improving competitiveness and leadership in the sector  \n and also a key driver in margin enhancement. ARYZTA intends to invest €100m  \n per annum in ATI over the next three years in optimising the supply chain to support the \n continued roll-out of ERP. The acceleration of ATI in FY 2012 will result in significant \n change across the Group. ATI is likely to result in the Group incurring an estimated  \n non-recurring cash cost of €100m over the next two financial years to July 2013 as a \n result of planned business restructuring measures. ARYZTA anticipates multiple  \n benefits from this investment over the implementation period targeting progressive \n revenue enhancement through maximising cross-selling opportunities. In addition, ATI is \n expected to enhance ARYZTA’s leadership position in speciality bakery and deliver  \n margin enhancement. The expected benefits arising from this transformative investment  \n forms a key driver of ARYZTA’s goal to deliver a return on investment of 15%+ from  \n the underlying Food business by FY 2015 (which equates to an average increment of \n 100-150bps per annum in ROI).\n \n Primary food inflation\n \n 12 \n The financial year has been one which has seen a return of food raw material inflation,\n triggering the need for price increases. The Group is working closely with customers  \n in mitigating the impact of pricing on the consumer through product innovation, selection \n and service model efficiencies. The outlook for food raw materials remains volatile and  \n is expected to remain as such for the foreseeable future. \n \n Financial position \n \n 13 \n ARYZTA’s 71.4% subsidiary and separately listed company, Origin Enterprises Plc (‘Origin’), \n has separate funding structures, which are financed without recourse to ARYZTA. \n Origin’s net debt amounted to €92.1m at 31 July 2011. The consolidated net debt of \n the Food Group excluding Origin’s non-recourse debt amounted to €955.5m. The  \n Food Group net debt: EBITDA ratio is 2.24x (excluding hybrid instrument as debt) and \n interest cover of 7.43x (excluding hybrid interest). The Food Group gross term debt \n weighted average maturity is circa 6.2 years. The weighted average interest cost of the \n Food Group financing facilities is circa 4.28%.

ARYZTA has a holding of 95m shares in Origin.\n \n Origin \n \n Origin reported excellent financial and operating results underpinned by a buoyant  \n trading environment for primary producers supporting firm demand for agronomy \n services and inputs. Origin completed significant repositioning of non-core businesses in \n the period and deployed the cash received from its non-core disposals to close three \n acquisitions in the UK (involving a total investment of €79.3m) which transformed  \n the scale and profile of its UK operations into the leading provider of agronomy advice \n and agri-inputs. In the year under review, Origin’s Agri-Services segment expanded  \n its EBIT margin by 50bps to 5.2% and reported a 29.3% increase in operating profits  \n to €66m. Origin reported fully diluted adjusted earnings per share of 43.34c, an increase \n of 16.3% on the prior year, and reduced its net debt by €19.8m to €92.1m, reflecting  \n a Net debt: EBITDA ratio of 1.17x. Origin’s ROI for the period was 19.8%.\n \n The Board of Origin has proposed a dividend per ordinary share of 11.0 cent for the \n period ended 31 July 2011. \n \n Origin’s separately published results, which were released on 22 September 2011, are \n available at www.originenterprises.com.\n \n Outlook\n \n 18 \n Economic outlook for mature markets continues to weaken amid continuing volatility  \n in raw material inputs and in financial markets. These conditions increase the downside \n risks to the global economic outlook significantly. Consumer spending remains  \n weak with footfall driven by increased promotional activity in all channels. Competition \n between ARYZTA’s customers has also increased in response to elevated levels of \n consumer switching between channels pulled by the promotional activity. \n \n ARYZTA’s strategy to deal with this challenging market environment is to leverage  \n key customer relationships to grow revenue, to focus on product development around  \n consumer insights and to identify and exploit cost efficiencies across the organisation.  \n This will be supported by increased investment in emerging markets and availing  \n of acquisition growth opportunities to add new customers, channels, products and \n geographies. \n \n ARYZTA has repositioned itself to become a leading global player in speciality bakery \n through the acquisitions completed just one year ago and now has a more balanced \n earnings flow. The resulting diversification arising from these acquisitions has also \n repositioned its access to more customers and channels providing a better balanced \n access to consumers.\n \n 1 \n \n  Based on EUR 0.4652 per share converted at the foreign exchange rate of one Euro to CHF 1.22082  \n on 22 September 2011, the date of the approval of the ARYZTA financial statements.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 21\n \n Financial and Business Review (continued)\n \n The Group has well diversified sources of finance with long maturity, supporting its \n continued investment grade status. These characteristics coupled with the planned \n investment of €100m in the ATI programme in each of the next three years will enhance \n ARYZTA’s leadership in the global bakery sector.\n \n ARYZTA believes that the current FY 2012 consensus EPS (338 cents) appears  \n reasonable at this early stage of the year. ARYZTA continues to believe that the FY 2013 \n EPS target of 400+ cent and the FY 2015 Food Group target of a return on investment  \n of 15%+ from underlying Food business remains valid.\n \n Principal risks and uncertainties\n \n 19 \n The Board and senior management have invested significant time and resources in \n identifying specific risks across the Group, and in developing a culture of balanced risk \n minimisation.

While recognising the importance of these formal  \n instruments, good corporate governance in practice requires a commitment to, and the \n practice of, values which guide the Group in serving the needs of its stakeholders, be \n they shareholders (institutional or retail), customers, consumers, suppliers, employees or \n other interested groups. It is also now appropriate to note some significant developments \n in the corporate governance sphere and specifically in the context of ARYZTA Board  \n composition, the ARYZTA Long Term Incentive Plan and ‘say-on-pay’ voting. \n \n ARYZTA Board \n In its July 2008 Prospectus ARYZTA undertook to review the composition of the Board  \n with a view to reducing its size. Also, in its 2009 and 2010 Corporate Governance \n Reports, ARYZTA stated its commitment to keeping its corporate governance framework \n under review with a view to on-going developments in the area and the on-going evolution \n of the Group. In keeping with these commitments, over the first three financial years of \n ARYZTA’s life, the Board has been reduced from 15 members to the current nine \n members. \n \n  \n \n The Board has now determined to undertake a round of renewal whereby the  \n appointment of additional independent non-executive directors would be proposed to the \n shareholders at the ARYZTA 2011 Annual General Meeting. In conjunction with this \n proposed round of renewal, and to reflect the on-going evolution and internationalisation of \n ARYZTA, the Board has discontinued the previous policy that a minimum of four of the \n non-executive directors be Irish and a minimum of two of the non-executive directors be \n Swiss. In addition, the Board has re-affirmed its policy that a majority of its membership, \n excluding the Chairman, shall consist of independent non-executive directors (as \n determined in accordance with the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate  \n Governance).  \n \n ARYZTA Long-Term Incentive Plan \n 31 July 2011 marks the completion of the first three year cycle of the ARYZTA Long Term \n Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). The ARYZTA Board has taken the opportunity of this third \n anniversary to introduce additional terms applicable to LTIP awards. The details of the \n ARYZTA LTIP and the related changes to its terms are set out in the Compensation \n Report on pages 46 to 53 of this Annual Report.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 25\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Compensation Report and ‘Say-on-Pay’ voting\n The ARYZTA Board has decided to revise the form in which it reports to shareholders on \n remuneration matters by the introduction of a separate Compensation Report. Moreover, \n having regard to current trends in corporate governance practice, the Board has decided \n to submit the ARYZTA 2011 Compensation Report to a separate advisory vote of the \n shareholders at the ARYZTA 2011 Annual General Meeting.\n \n ARYZTA Corporate Governance Report Format \n The ARYZTA Corporate Governance Report 2011 follows the SIX Swiss Exchange \n Directive on Information Relating to Corporate Governance and takes into account the \n Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance. \n \n The ARYZTA Group and Company Financial Statements 2011 comply with International \n Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and are in accordance with Swiss law. Where \n necessary, the financial statement disclosures have been extended to comply with the \n requirements of the SIX Swiss Exchange Directive on Information Relating to Corporate \n Governance. \n \n In this report, the terms ‘ARYZTA’ and ‘Company’ refer to ARYZTA AG whereas ‘Group’ \n and ‘ARYZTA Group’ refer to the Company and its subsidiaries. The ‘Board’ refers to the \n Board of Directors of the Company. ‘Origin Enterprises’ means Origin Enterprises plc \n (ARYZTA has a 71.4 % holding in Origin Enterprises plc), and the ‘Origin Board’ means \n the Board of Directors of Origin Enterprises plc. In some sections, to avoid duplication, \n cross-reference is made to the 2011 Financial Statements (comprising the Group Financial \n Statements and Company Financial Statements of ARYZTA), as well as to the Articles of \n Association of ARYZTA AG (available on the Company website at www.aryzta.com/\n about-aryzta/corporate-governance.aspx). \n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 26\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Group structure and shareholders \n   Group structure\n \n 1 \n 1.1 \n The Group is structured conventionally. That is, the ARYZTA General Meeting is the \n supreme corporate body and the Board is accountable and reports to the shareholders,  \n by whom it is elected. The Board, while entrusted with the ultimate direction of ARYZTA \n as well as the supervision and control of management, has delegated responsibility for \n the day-to-day management of the Group, through the Chief Executive Officer,  \n to Executive Management. The Group’s management and organisation structure  \n corresponds to its segmental reporting lines, being Food Europe, Food North America, \n Food Rest of World and Origin.  \n \n Each key segment’s management team is responsible for the day-to-day activities of their \n segments and report to Executive Management, which in turn reports through the Chief \n Executive Officer to the Board. Origin Enterprises plc constitutes an exception. It is a public \n company in its own right, with its own Board of Directors, separate executive management \n team, governance structure and ring-fenced financing arrangements. The executive \n management team within Origin Enterprises reports to the Origin Board. The Origin Board \n is accountable and reports to its shareholders, including ARYZTA. Owen Killian and \n Patrick McEniff, ARYZTA Board members and CEO and CFO respectively, are members \n of the Origin Board.

Submissions were received from \n a number of major accounting firms. The award decision was based on a set of criteria \n which had previously been disclosed to all candidate firms. These criteria included  \n such elements as the composition of the audit team, knowledge of the bakery industry \n sector and differentiation vis-à-vis other candidate firms. The ultimate decision was  \n made on the basis of general best practice principles. Following a formal tender process, \n PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Zurich, was elected as statutory auditor and Group auditor \n in December 2009. The term of office is one year. Patrick Balkanyi has been the lead \n auditor since PricewaterhouseCoopers AG’s appointment in 2009. At the 2010 AGM, \n PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Zurich, was re-elected as statutory auditor and Group \n auditor for the 2011 financial year.\n \n Audit fees\n \n 8.2 \n The total audit and audit-related fees charged by the Group auditors in the financial  \n year 2011 amounted to €2,458,000. €265,000 of these fees were charged to Origin \n Enterprises plc.\n \n The total audit and audit-related fees charged by the Group auditors in the financial  \n year 2010 amounted to €1,787,000. €312,000 of these fees were charged to Origin \n Enterprises plc.\n \n Additional fees\n \n 8.3 \n The Group’s policy is to manage its relationship with the Group’s external auditor in  \n such a way that their independence is maintained. To ensure that this is so, the Board \n has determined limits on the type and scale of non-audit work that can be provided  \n by the auditor.\n \n Contracts to the auditor for other non-audit work are deemed to be pre-approved by the \n Audit Committee up to an aggregate limit, within the financial year, of 100% of the \n current year audit fee. This is subject to the requirement for all contracts for specific \n pieces of non-audit work with fees exceeding €250,000 being awarded on the basis of \n competitive tendering. Where the awarding of a contract for non-audit work to the auditor \n is to be made that is likely to increase total fees for non-audit work above this aggregate \n limit in the financial year, the Group Chief Financial Officer notifies the Chairman of the \n Audit Committee in advance of such a contract being awarded. \n \n The fees for additional services rendered to ARYZTA Group by the auditors and invoiced \n in the financial year 2011 totalled €2,495,000 for taxation and legal services. Of these \n fees €61,000 was charged to Origin Enterprises plc.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 42\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Information tools pertaining to the external audit\n \n 8.4 \n PricewaterhouseCoopers presents to the Audit Committee a detailed report on the \n conduct of the 2011 financial statements audit, the findings on significant financial \n accounting and reporting issues as well as the findings on the Group’s internal control \n system (ICS).\n \n In 2011, PricewaterhouseCoopers attended four Audit Committee meetings and the \n Group Head of Internal Audit participated in all four Audit Committee meetings. Other \n members of the Group Executive Management attended them as invited. In addition,  \n the Head of Internal Audit regularly met with the Chairman of the Audit Committee  \n for interim updates.\n \n The Board of Directors annually reviews the selection of the auditors in order to  \n propose their appointment to the General Meeting of ARYZTA. The Audit Committee \n assesses the effectiveness of the work of the auditors in accordance with Swiss law.  \n The lead auditor rotates every seven years in accordance with Swiss law.\n \n At each meeting of the Audit Committee, audit and non-audit-related fees paid to \n PricewaterhouseCoopers year to date are reviewed to mitigate the risk of any potential \n impairment to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ independence. PricewaterhouseCoopers \n monitors its independence throughout the year and confirms its independence to the \n Audit Committee annually.\n \n Investor Communications Policy\n \n 9 \n Guiding principles\n ARYZTA is committed to pursuing an open and consistent communication policy with\n shareholders, potential investors and other interested parties. The objective is to ensure\n that the perception of those parties about the historical record, current performance\n and future prospects of ARYZTA is in line with management’s assessment of the current\n situation at ARYZTA. The guiding principles of this policy are that ARYZTA gives equal\n treatment to shareholders in equal situations, that any price sensitive information is\n published in a timely fashion and that the information is provided in a format that is as\n complete, simple, transparent and consistent as possible.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 43\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Methodology\n ARYZTA publishes its first quarterly trading update, half-year results, nine-months’ trading\n update and full-year results (including Annual Report) on the occasion of its quarterly\n announcement cycle (announcement dates on next page). These quarterly announce-\n ments are accompanied by a news release and or a presentation and a conference call \n which is broadcast live on the internet (webcast) and which anyone can choose to access, \n whether that person is a shareholder or not. These webcasts can be replayed at any  \n time on the ARYZTA website (www.aryzta.com). An automatic alerting service is also \n provided through the website. This ensures that interested parties can sign up to the site \n to be alerted automatically to results and events announcements published on the \n website. ARYZTA also ensures that news releases are distributed to major wire and news  \n services. These news releases are also made available in the News & Media section  \n of the website immediately after release to the SIX Swiss Exchange and ISE Irish Exchange \n (www.aryzta.com/news-and-media.aspx). In this way, the Company utilises its website  \n and ancillary communications infrastructure to ensure a rapid and equitable distribution  \n of information for all interested parties. \n \n ARYZTA’s Investor Relations programme for institutional investors is carried out in line \n with the quarterly announcement cycle, with management time allocated accordingly and \n not on an ad-hoc basis. In March 2011, ARYZTA appointed a dedicated communication \n officer to focus on the management of the communication process with investors and the \n media, and to support ARYZTA’s efforts to strike a balance between the needs of  \n managing a business and regular transparent communication with investors. ARYZTA’s \n policy regarding investor meetings (i.e. Group meetings, one-to-one meetings and \n conference calls) is that these will not be held on an ad-hoc basis. These will be organised  \n following quarterly announcements, save as mentioned below. Investors wishing to meet \n the Group in the aftermath of such quarterly announcements should e-mail the Group’s \n Investor Relations co-ordinator (see details on page 44 of this Annual Report). These \n investor communications focus either on recently announced financial results, recent \n corporate activity or the longer-term strategy of the Group. They do not serve the purpose \n of disclosing new information which might encourage an investment decision.\n \n The Group accepts invitations to investor conferences. Attendance at conferences by  \n the Group will be on a planned and agreed basis in advance of its quarterly announcement\n cycle and published on its website. The Company also communicates with analysts and \n stockbrokers who follow ARYZTA to facilitate third-party research on the Company.\n ARYZTA assumes no responsibility for any statements, expectations, or recommendations\n made by analysts and stockbrokers. The Group will communicate to investors at the time \n of any potentially price-sensitive event, such as significant acquisitions and divestments, \n joint venture agreements and alliances.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 44\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Investor relations contact details\n \n ARYZTA AG \n Talacker 41\n 8001 Zurich\n Switzerland\n Tel: +41 (0) 44 583 42 00\n Fax: +41 (0) 44 583 42 49\n E-mail: info@aryzta.com \n \n Key dates to December 2012\n \n Announcement of the 2011 annual results\n Issue of the 2011 annual report \n First quarter trading update\n Annual General Meeting \n Payment of dividend \n Announcement of half-year results 2012 \n Third quarter trading update\n Announcement of the 2012 annual results\n Issue of the 2012 annual report\n First quarter trading update\n Annual General Meeting 2012\n \n 26 September 2011\n 4 October 2011\n 28 November 2011\n 1 December 2011\n 1 February 2012\n 12 March 2012\n 5 June 2012\n 24 September 2012\n  2 October 2012\n 3 December 2012\n 6 December 2012\n \n \fFood rest oF world\n MAlAysIA\n Johor Bahru\n Park along Ji Ibrahim\n \n ARYZTA has 1 manufacturing centre and \n 3 distribution centres operating across Malaysia.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 46\n \n Annual Report and Accounts 2011\n Compensation Report\n \n Compensation Report 2011 \n \n Introduction\n ARYZTA’s overriding long-term goal is to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and \n deliver enhanced shareholder value. ARYZTA pursues this objective in a competitive and \n changing environment. ARYZTA’s success is intrinsically connected with its ability to  \n attract, retain and motivate good people who are incentivised to achieve ARYZTA’s  \n corporate goals. ARYZTA’s remuneration tools, in particular the ARYZTA Long-Term \n Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)1, are key instruments in this regard.\n \n 31 July 2011 marks the completion of the first three year cycle of the LTIP. ARYZTA has \n taken the opportunity of this third anniversary to:\n – \n – \n – \n  \n \n revise the form in which it reports to shareholders on remuneration matters; \n introduce additional conditions and terms relating to the LTIP;  \n implement new criteria applicable to the determination of the annual bonus element  \n of Executive Management remuneration.\n \n Moreover, in light of current trends in corporate governance practice, the Board has  \n decided to submit this Compensation Report to a separate advisory vote of the shareholders \n at the ARYZTA 2011 Annual General Meeting.\n \n Part 1 of the Compensation Report explains the remuneration system focusing on:\n – \n – \n – \n \n the corporate goals pursued by ARYZTA;\n the LTIP as employed in the pursuit of those goals; \n the cost of the LTIP.\n \n Part 2 of the Compensation Report sets out relevant compensation details for the 2011 \n financial year.\n \n Compensation Report – Part 1\n \n Corporate Goals\n The LTIP is intended to direct and focus management’s efforts towards the achievement \n of ARYZTA’s key corporate goals over the long-term as set by the Board and communicated \n to the market through ARYZTA’s investor relations activities. \n \n –  EPS growth \n  \n \n  In ARYZTA’s July 2008 Prospectus, it set itself the goal, as a primary strategic \n objective, of doubling its earnings base within 5 years. The Board continues to target \n 15% compound annual earnings growth. \n \n –  Shareholder Value \n  \n  \n  \n \n  The pursuit of earnings growth is not an isolated end in itself. The underlying \n purpose is to support the delivery of significant value for shareholders. This \n imperative is supported through adherence to prudent capital discipline policies.\n \n 1  \n  \n \n THE ARYZTA Long-Term Incentive Plan refers to both the Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent  \n Plan.  \n \n  \n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 47\n \n Compensation Report (continued)\n \n ARYZTA actual EPS growth over the initial three year period to 31 July 2011\n Over the initial three year cycle of the LTIP, underlying fully diluted EPS has been driven \n from the 2008 base of 202.2 cent to 310.1 cent at 31 July 2011. This growth, at more \n than 15% compound per annum, has been achieved in the face of major changes in the \n economic environment in which ARYZTA operates: changes which have impacted \n customers, suppliers, commodity prices, financing and, especially, consumers. Moreover, \n and in recognition of and response to the changed and changing environment, ARYZTA \n has, over the initial three year cycle, put in place stable, long-term financing facilities and \n undertaken significant acquisition initiatives. These acquisition initiatives have significantly \n diversified ARYZTA’s customer channel, product and geographic profile to achieve a more \n balanced mix, while at the same time increasing exposure to developing markets.\n \n Shareholder Value, Capital Discipline\n While pursuing 15% compound annual growth in EPS, ARYZTA policy is to maintain \n investment grade credit status. Capital discipline controls applicable to the LTIP are as \n follows:\n \n –  ROIC and WACC\n  \n \n  The rules governing awards under the LTIP require that the ARYZTA Food Group \n Return on Invested Capital1 (‘ROIC’) over the performance period must exceed \n ARYZTA’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital2 (‘WACC’).\n \n  \n –  Dividend Policy \n  \n ARYZTA has adopted the additional vesting condition, applicable to LTIP awards  \n   made after 31 July 2011, requiring that the Board would continue to recommend  \n  \n  \n  \n \n throughout the performance period adherence to ARYZTA dividend policy.  \n ARYZTA dividend policy is that payout ratio is based on 15% of underlying fully  \n diluted EPS. \n \n The LTIP as employed in the pursuit of the Corporate Goals \n To date, ARYZTA has employed the Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan to \n focus pursuit of its corporate goals.\n \n Two parallel plans \n Having the Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan running in parallel gives \n beneficial tension in the pursuit of the corporate goals between the pursuit of EPS growth, \n the driver of returns under the Matching Plan, and the need for long-term share price \n growth which is necessary to make valuable awards under the Option Equivalent Plan. \n \n Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for this purpose refers to the ARYZTA Food Group earnings before interest  \n tax and amortisation (EBITA) taken as a percentage of ARYZTA Food Group net assets. For this purpose,  \n EBITA includes the net profit contribution from associates and JVs (i.e. after interest and tax) and excludes  \n the impact of non-recurring items. Net assets exclude all bank debt, cash, cash equivalents and tax-related  \n balances. ROIC is reported to investors in conjunction with announcement of yearly and half-yearly results  \n and presented on a Group basis and segmental basis. For the financial year 2011, ROIC was 10.2%.\n \n 1  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n 2  WACC is determined as a blend of ARYZTA’s deemed cost of capital and deemed cost of debt with each of  \n  \n  \n  \n \n these components weighted on the basis of ARYZTA’s debt to equity ratio. WACC is measured annually \n by an external specialist, using standard calculation methodology and reported to investors in conjunction  \n with announcement of yearly and half-yearly results. For the financial year 2011, the pre-tax WACC was 8.0%.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 48\n \n Compensation Report (continued)\n \n The Matching Plan – vesting of awards made in financial year ending 31 July 2009 \n Participants with Matching Plan awards made in financial year ending 31 July 20091 \n had the prospect of receiving a multiple (ranging from one to three times) of the number \n of Qualifying Investment Shares recognised as held for the purposes of the Matching \n Plan, subject to satisfaction of the applicable rules, including notably the EPS growth \n target2 and compliance with the condition that ROIC must have exceeded WACC. \n Compound annual growth in underlying fully diluted EPS over the three year period has \n exceeded 15%, the highest earnings growth performance hurdle. The condition that \n ROIC exceed WACC has also been met. Accordingly, the performance conditions have \n been achieved to vest three shares per recognised Qualifying Investment Share.\n \n The Matching Plan – future awards \n As set out above, ARYZTA has resolved to supplement the capital discipline condition  \n that the ARYZTA Food Group ROIC must exceed WACC for LTIP awards made after  \n 31 July 2011 through the adoption of the additional condition regarding maintenance of \n the ARYZTA dividend policy.\n \n In addition, for future awards, vesting may occur on a fractional pro-rata basis ranging \n from a multiple of 1 to 3 for growth between 10.0% and 15.0% rather than thresholds of \n 1, 2 and 3 at 10.0% to 12.4%, 12.5% to 15.0% and 15.0% or more. In the event of  \n the minimum 10% growth target not being achieved, no awards vest.\n \n The Option Equivalent Plan \n Awards under the Option Equivalent Plan were made in financial year ending 31 July \n 2010. No awards were made under the Option Equivalent Plan in the financial years \n ending 31 July 2009 or 31 July 2011. Vesting of awards under the Option Equivalent \n Plan is conditional on compound annual growth in underlying fully diluted EPS in three \n consecutive accounting periods exceeding the growth in the Euro zone Core Consumer \n Price Index plus 5 %3. The new condition regarding maintenance of the ARYZTA dividend \n policy will also apply to new awards under the Option Equivalent Plan. \n \n Cost of the LTIP\n The cost of the Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan can be considered in \n accounting and dilutive terms.\n \n LTIP – Accounting Cost \n Awards under the LTIP are equity-settled share-based payments as defined in IFRS 2, \n Share-based Payment. Note 8 of the Group Financial Statements details the total cost of \n €19,063,0004 recognised in relation to share-based payments for the financial year 2011.\n \n 1   No awards under the Matching Plan were made in the financial years ending 31 July 2010 or 31 July 2011.\n 2 \n  \n  \n 3  \n  \n 4 \n  \n \n Compound annual growth in underlying fully diluted EPS over the period had to equal or exceed the  \n minimum 10% EPS growth target, having expensed the awards in the Income Statement in accordance  \n with IFRS. \n The cost of awards under the Option Equivalent Plan is charged to the Income Statement over the current  \n estimated vesting period from grant date. \n Includes costs of Executive Management and other management participants in the LTIP and costs of the  \n Origin Plan which is specifically not available to ARYZTA executives, officers or employees. \n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 49\n \n Compensation Report (continued)\n \n –  LTIP – Dilutive effect and 10% / ten year rule\n  \n \n  The LTIP has a ten year life and expires on 31 July 2019. Under the LTIP rules, not \n more than 10% of share capital may be allocated for issue over this ten year life \n pursuant to LTIP awards. \n \n –  LTIP – Adoption of additional dilutive control rule\n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n ARYZTA has resolved to supplement the existing ten year/10% dilutive control rule  \n by the adoption of the additional control that, for the three year cycle commencing 1  \n August 2011, not more than 3.0% of share capital should be allocated for issue  \n under the LTIP (all plans).\n \n –  Dilutive effect of all awards under the LTIP\n  \n \n  Full vesting and exercise of all awards outstanding made over the first three year \n cycle of the LTIP (Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan) would deliver a \n maximum 2,175,000 shares to participants – i.e. 2.62% dilution for delivery of > \n 15.0% compound annual growth rate in EPS (having expensed the awards)1.\n >   Dilutive effect of all awards under the Matching Plan – Full vesting of all outstanding \n Matching Awards made over the first three year cycle of the LTIP delivers 975,000 \n shares to participants – i.e. 1.18% dilution or 0.39% per annum.\n \n >   Dilutive effect of all awards under the Option Equivalent Plan – Full exercise of all \n awards made to date under the Option Equivalent Plan would deliver 1,200,000 \n shares to participants – i.e. 1.44% dilution or 0.48% per annum.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n Annual bonus and ROIC\n To date, the annual short-term performance related bonus element of Executive \n Management remuneration has been determined primarily based on delivery of the \n annual budget for the Group. For financial year 2012, it is intended that annual bonus \n will be determined by reference to incremental gains in ROIC. This change in how  \n the annual bonus is determined will apply to Executive Management and other senior \n executives throughout the Group.\n \n 1   Disregarding the fact that the earliest vesting date for outstanding Option Equivalents is 31 July 2012.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 50\n \n Compensation Report (continued)\n \n Compensation Report – Part 2\n \n Compensation Process\n The Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board (‘NRC’) is responsible for \n determining the remuneration of executive and non-executive members of the Board and \n for approving the remuneration of other members of senior management upon the \n recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer. Executives are remunerated in line with \n the level of their authority and responsibility within the Group, with the various elements \n of the remuneration package for Executive Management being reviewed annually by the \n NRC. \n \n The NRC reports to the Board at each Board meeting next succeeding each meeting of \n the NRC. The CEO attends meetings of the NRC by invitation only.\n \n Consultation with market participants with regard to the LTIP was undertaken during  \n the financial year 2011. This consultation has informed the decision of the NRC and \n Board to:\n \n revise the form in which ARYZTA reports to shareholders on remuneration matters;\n introduce additional conditions and terms relating to the LTIP;\n implement new criteria applicable to the determination of the annual bonus element  \n of Executive Management remuneration;\n \n – \n – \n – \n  \n –  submit this compensation report to a separate advisory vote of the shareholders at the  \n  \n \n ARYZTA 2011 Annual General Meeting.\n \n Against that background, it was decided not to undertake a benchmarking exercise  \n in relation to Executive Management remuneration (short term and long term) during the \n financial year 2011.\n \n The cost of the long-term element of Executive Management remuneration (i.e. the \n Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan) is controlled through the dilution control \n rules and by the fact that rights generally vest only after accounting for the cost of the \n initial award (per IFRS 2, Share-based Payment). Within the prescribed limits, the NRC \n controls the level of participation by individuals. The NRC also controls the maximum \n level of the short-term performance related bonus for Executive Management. \n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 51\n \n Compensation Report (continued)\n \n Compensation to members of the Board of Directors\n Non-executive Board members are paid a yearly fee which reflects the time commitment \n and responsibilities of the role. Additional compensation is payable for service on a  \n Board Committee (including the Chair thereof). The NRC determines at its discretion  \n the level of the yearly fee and additional compensation paid to each non-executive  \n Board member. Non-executive Board members are not eligible for performance-related \n payments and do not participate in the LTIP.\n \n in CHF `000\n Denis Lucey\n Albert Abderhalden1\n Charles Adair1\n \n Denis Buckley\n J Brian Davy\n Noreen Hynes1\n Hugo Kane1\n Owen Killian (CEO)\n Patrick McEniff (CFO)\n William Murphy\n Hans Sigrist\n Dr J Maurice Zufferey\n Total\n 1 \n  \n 2 \n  \n \n Direct payments\n year ended  \n 31 July 2011\n 323\n \n Direct payments\n year ended  \n 31 July 2010\n 323\n \n 29\n \n 59\n \n 96\n 112\n 37\n 29\n 88\n 88\n 105\n 93\n 96\n 1,155\n \n 88\n \n –\n \n 96\n 112\n 112\n 88\n 88\n 88\n 96\n 88\n 96\n 1,275\n \n A.

The Group has formal risk assessment processes in place through which \n risks and mitigating controls are evaluated. These processes are driven by business  \n unit management, who are best placed to identify the significant ongoing and emerging \n risks facing the businesses. The outputs of these risk assessment processes are sub ject \n to various levels of review by management, and a consolidated Risk Map is reviewed  \n by the ARYZTA Board of Directors on an annual basis. Risks identified and associated \n mitigating controls are also subject to audit as part of operational, financial and health  \n and safety audit programmes.\n \n The key risks facing the Group include the following:1\n –  As an international Group with substantial operations and interests outside the \n \n eurozone, ARYZTA is subject to the risk of adverse movements in foreign currency \n exchange rates.\n \n –  The Group faces business risks associated with cash and collectables given the  \n \n current curtailment of credit for all businesses.\n \n –  Operational risks facing the Group include issues associated with product contamina-\n \n tion and general food scares affecting relevant products. \n \n –  Changing dietary trends and the increased emphasis on health and wellness among \n \n consumers present both opportunities and risks for the Group.\n \n –  A further risk to the Group, in common with most companies, is the risk of failure \n \n to address increasing compliance requirements in areas such as health and safety, \n emissions and effluent control. \n \n –  The loss of a significant manufacturing / operational site through natural catastrophe \n \n or act of vandalism represents a risk that could, potentially, have a material impact on \n the Group.\n \n –  Similarly, a significant IT or security system failure could adversely impact on  \n \n operations. \n \n –  The Group faces the challenge of fluctuations in commodity and energy costs. \n –  The Group faces the risk of a decrease in consumer spending in the current  \n \n economic climate.\n \n –  The Group faces the risk of impairment of its various brands and intangibles.\n –  Having grown both organically and through acquisitions, the Group faces risks and \n challenges associated with managing growth, and ensuring that processes around \n acquiring and integrating new businesses are robust.\n \n –  The Group faces risks associated with the potential loss of key management  \n \n – \n \n personnel. \n In the event that the Group breaches a financing covenant it may have to renegotiate \n its facilities resulting in a higher cost of funds for the Group.\n \n –  The loss of a significant supplier as a result of the current economic environment \n \n could adversely impact ongoing operations of the business.\n \n –  As the Group operates in a competitive industry, it is subject to the risk of the loss of a \n \n significant customer.\n \n –  The implementation of a future Group-wide ERP system requires substantial  \n \n investment, and would result in significant costs in the event of a failed implementation.\n \n 1 \n \n These risks are not listed in order of importance.\n \n \fFood EuropE\n EnGlAnd\n Cambridge\n Garret Hostel Bridge\n \n ARYZTA has 1 manufacturing centre and \n 11 distribution centres operating across the UK.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 57\n \n Annual Report and Accounts 2011\n Our Responsibility\n \n ARYZTA is committed to building a successful and sustainable business for the long \n term. Sustainability requires the marrying of economic, environmental and social factors \n i. e. corporate responsibility. ARYZTA pursues a decentralised approach to corporate \n responsibility through its various businesses and the different markets within which they \n operate. The following key pillars of corporate responsibility are applied by ARYZTA  \n businesses in their approach to sustainability.\n \n Community\n ARYZTA believes in building long-term relationships with its stakeholders, which include \n consumers, customers, employees, shareholders and regulatory bodies. The Group \n understands its responsibilities as an important member of the communities in which it \n operates. It emboldens its businesses to play an active role within them. As well as \n providing employment opportunities, the Group aims to make positive contributions to its \n community, building relationships and earning a positive reputation as a good employer, \n neighbour and corporate citizen.\n \n With regard to business ethics, ARYZTA expects all commercial dealings by or on behalf \n of the Group to be conducted with integrity and respect for all parties, as well as in \n compliance with local and national legislation.\n \n Workplace\n ARYZTA recognises that its continued success is dependent on the quality, commitment \n and responsible behaviour of its people. It therefore provides clear policies and direction \n to the management teams of its operating businesses. ARYZTA continues to strive for  \n the highest standards in management practices. The Group provides equal opportunities \n in recruitment, selection, promotion, employee development, training and reward policies \n and procedures. ARYZTA also complies with applicable national laws and industry \n standards on working hours. \n \n Safety is of paramount importance for ARYZTA. It pursues comprehensive internal safety \n management procedures, including policy manuals, verification of regulatory compliance, \n risk assessments, individual site action plans, safety audits, training, formal accident \n investigation and the provision of occupational health services. It also maintains a strong \n focus on the use of key performance indicators, external auditing and achieving exacting \n external health and safety accreditation for its operations.  \n \n Marketplace\n To ensure all our food products are manufactured with the highest standards of safety, \n all of ARYZTA’s food processing facilities operate under proprietary HACCP (Hazard \n Analysis and Critical Control Point) systems, or similar, and in compliance with all \n related food law in force. All food safety and quality systems are certified by independent \n third party bodies. To this end, ARYZTA food businesses contribute to various voluntary \n initiatives on food and product safety by industry associations such as the International \n Featured Standards (IFS-Food and IFS-Logistics), British Retail Consortium (BRC), \n American Institute of Baking (AIB) or the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). \n  \n  \n  \n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n 58\n \n Our Responsibility (continued)\n \n Environment\n ARYZTA is committed to a policy of sustainable economic development.

On 26 November 2010, Origin further  \n announced that Valeo had completed the simultaneous acquisitions of the branded food \n businesses of Origin and the Irish food company Batchelors. With effect from 26 November  \n 2010, Origin’s 44.1% investment in Valeo has been treated as an associate undertaking \n and accounted for using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments  \n in Associates. \n \n A loss of €7,301,000 was realised on the disposal of Origin Foods to Valeo. The \n impact of this loss on ARYZTA’s profit attributable to equity shareholders for the period  \n is €5,214,000 which is after deduction of Origin non-controlling interests.

The all-Ireland business was formed through the integration of Origin’s \n R&H Hall (‘Hall’) business in the Republic of Ireland with the business of Origin and  \n Barnett in Northern Ireland. The transaction was completed on 28 January 2011. Under \n the terms of the transaction, Barnett acquired a 50% interest in Hall, mirroring the  \n economic interests of Origin and Barnett in the Northern Ireland business. \n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 86\n \n Notes to the Group Financial Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n Origin now holds a 50% interest in Hall and, from 28 January 2011, this 50% holding \n is treated as an associate undertaking in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates. \n A gain arose on the transaction as follows:\n \n in Euro `000\n Net assets transferred on 28 January 2011:\n Property, plant and equipment\n Working capital\n Provisions for liabilities and charges\n Net assets transferred\n \n Consideration:\n Net cash consideration\n Fair value of 50% equity interest in Hall\n Total consideration received\n \n Gain on disposal of Origin Feed business\n \n 2011\n \n (15,412)\n (35,704)\n 2,667\n (48,449)\n \n 40,562\n 11,055\n 51,617\n \n 3,168\n \n Acquisition related costs in financial year 2011\n \n 2.2 \n Total acquisition related transaction costs incurred during the period of €12,825,000.  \n The ARYZTA Food Group incurred €10,686,000 relating primarily to the acquisition  \n of the outstanding 50% of Maidstone Bakeries.

As a result Origin’s shareholding reduced from 38.7% to 24.2%. This  \n gave rise to a loss of €4,738,000 on the dilution of the holding, which is recorded in the \n income statement for the year ended 31 July 2011.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 87\n \n Notes to the Group Financial Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n Integration and rationalisation related costs \n \n 2.4 \n During the period, the Group commenced two separate integration and rationalisation \n programmes in each of its Food Europe and Food North America segments. These  \n programmes will allow the development of two principal operating platforms in Food \n Europe and Food North America to optimise the Group’s manufacturing and business \n support platforms.\n \n As a result of decisions made through these projects the Group has incurred and  \n provided for costs to be incurred during the financial period through its income statement \n as follows:\n \n Asset write-downs in financial year 2011 \n As part of the implementation of the Group’s integration and rationalisation programs  \n the Group has commenced the closure and/or reduction in activity of a number of its \n operational sites. As part of this process, the Group has written down certain manu-\n facturing, distribution and administration assets related to these sites during the period \n for a total charge of €43,039,000. Included in this charge is a write-down for a property \n situated in Tallaght, Ireland which was decommissioned and transferred to investment \n properties during the financial year.\n \n Severance and other staff related costs\n The Group has incurred and provided for €46,963,000 in severance and other costs \n during the period in relation to employees whose service was discontinued following the \n actual or announced closure and rationalisation of certain Group operational sites. \n \n Contractual obligations\n The operational decisions made through the Group’s integration and rationalisation \n projects triggered an early termination and/or resulted in certain operational contracts \n becoming onerous. The Group has incurred total costs during the period to either exit or \n provide for such contracts of €3,969,000.\n \n Grant related costs\n The termination of certain activities caused by the Group’s integration and rationalisation \n programmes have resulted in the triggering of certain grant repayment conditions. This \n has resulted in a charge of €2,338,000 related to repayment of grants.\n \n Advisory costs and other costs\n The Group has identified €13,422,000 in other costs related directly to the implementa-\n tion of its integration and rationalisation programmes during the period.

Vesting  \n is determined by reference to underlying fully diluted EPS growth. Compound growth  \n in underlying fully diluted EPS in any three consecutive financial years ending after 31 July  \n 2008 must exceed 10 %, with vesting accruing as per the following table:\n \n Underlying fully diluted \n EPS compound growth \n 15 % or more\n >12.5 % < 15 %\n 10 % to 12.4 %\n < 10 %\n Awards under the Matching Plan are subject to additional conditions, including notably:  \n (a) the requirement to remain in service throughout the performance period; (b) the  \n requirement to hold recognised qualifying interests throughout the performance period; \n and (c) the requirement that the ARYZTA Food Group’s return on invested capital  \n over the expected performance period is not less than its weighted average cost of capital. \n \n Multiple \n (qualifying in-\n vestment shares)\n 3\n 2\n 1\n 0\n \n The fair value assigned to equity entitlements issued under the ARYZTA Matching Plan \n LTIP represents the full value of an ordinary share on the date of grant adjusted for  \n the estimated lost dividends between date of issue and vesting date and the nominal \n value of the share.\n \n The costs of the Matching Awards under the LTIP are charged to the income statement \n over the estimated vesting period. Each year an assessment is made as to the probability \n of the number of plan participants who will fulfil the vesting conditions, what multiple \n of qualifying investment shares will be met and the period over which they will vest. \n The total estimated charge over the vesting period is €18,309,000 (CHF 23,549,000) \n of which €17,408,000 (CHF 22,391,000) has been charged to date.

The \n vesting of the share option equivalents granted is conditional on the growth rate in  \n underlying fully diluted EPS in any three consecutive accounting periods exceeding  \n the growth in the Eurozone Core Consumer Price Index plus 5 %. In addition, the return \n on invested capital over the relevant three-year performance period must not be  \n less than the weighted average cost of capital of the Group, and the individual must be  \n in on-going employment. \n \n The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the equity  \n option equivalents in cash. The costs of the Option Equivalent Plan LTIP are charged to \n the income statement over the expected vesting period from grant date.\n \n The weighted average fair value assigned to share option equivalents granted under  \n the ARYZTA Option Equivalent Plan LTIP was determined using the Black-Scholes  \n valuation model. The significant inputs into the model were the price of the shares as at \n the grant date, an expected option life of 4.75 years, expected share price volatility  \n of 28.25 %, the exercise price of CHF 37.23, the expected dividend yield of 1.5 %, and \n the risk-free rate of 1.1 %. The volatility, measured at the standard deviation of  \n continuously compounded share returns, is based on statistical analysis of monthly  \n share prices of a peer group over the period of 4.75 years.\n \n None of these equity entitlements have vested at the end of the year.\n \n   The Origin Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘Origin Plan’)\n \n 8.3 \n Participation in the Origin Plan is available only to employees of Origin and is specifically not \n available to ARYZTA executives, officers or employees.\n \n Origin Plan – ordinary share awards\n Under the terms of the Origin Plan, 4,682,134 ordinary shares were issued to senior \n executives of Origin during the year ended 31 July 2007. As the consideration paid for \n these shares equalled their fair value, no additional share-based compensation charge \n was recorded under IFRS 2, Share-based Payment. To retain the ordinary shares  \n issued under the terms of the Origin Plan, the senior executives must remain with Origin \n Enterprises plc for five years and financial and business targets must be achieved.

No impairment losses have been recognised  \n in respect of the Group’s cash-generating units in the years ended 31 July 2011 and  \n 31 July 2010.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 100\n \n Notes to the Group Financial Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on value-in-use calculations. \n Those calculations use cash flow projections based on expected future operating results \n and related cash flows. These projections are based on current operating results of the \n individual cash-generating units and an assumption regarding future organic growth. For \n the purposes of the calculation of value-in-use, the cash flows are projected over a three \n year period, with additional cash flows in subsequent years calculated using a terminal \n value methodology. \n \n The cash flows are discounted using appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates as  \n disclosed in the table above. The weighted average of those rates is 7.7 % (2010: 8.6 %), \n reflecting the risk associated with the individual future cash flows and the risk-free rate. \n Any significant adverse change in the expected future operational results and cash flows \n may result in the value-in-use being less than the carrying amount of a cash-generating \n unit and would require that the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit be impaired \n and stated at the greater of the value-in-use or the recoverable amount of the business \n unit. However, the results of the impairment testing undertaken at 31 July 2011 provide \n sufficient headroom such that any reasonable movement in any of the underlying  \n assumptions would not give rise to an impairment charge. Reducing the future growth \n rate to 0 .0% does not give rise to an impairment. The overall weighted average cost of \n capital of the Group pre-tax is 8.0% (2010: 8.1%) and post-tax is 6.7% (2010: 6.5%).\n \n The term of the discounted cash flow model is a significant factor in determining the fair \n value of the cash-generating units. The term has been arrived at by taking account of  \n the Group’s strong financial position, its established history of earnings growth and cash \n flow generation and its proven ability to pursue and integrate value-enhancing acquisitions.\n \n Key assumptions include management’s estimates of future profitability and maintenance \n capital expenditure requirements.\n \n The goodwill included within the carrying amount of investments in associates and joint \n ventures is subject to impairment testing when an indicator of impairment arises.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 101\n \n Notes to the Group Financial Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n 15 \n \n Investments in associates and joint ventures\n \n 31 July 2011\n in Euro `000\n At 1 August 2010\n Share of profits, after tax\n Contributions to existing associates \n \n and JVs \n \n Arising on business combinations\n Dividends received\n JV becoming a subsidiary\n Subsidiaries becoming associates\n Loss on dilution of investment \n (Losses)/gains through other \n \n comprehensive income\n Translation adjustments\n At 31 July 2011\n \n 31 July 2010\n in Euro `000\n At 1 August 2009\n Share of profits, after tax\n Contributions to existing associates \n \n and JVs \n \n Arising on business combinations\n Dividends received\n Losses recognised through other \n \n comprehensive income\n Translation adjustments\n At 31 July 2010\n \n Notes\n \n Share of  \n associates  \n net assets\n 37,769\n 2,831\n \n Share of  \n joint ventures  \n net assets\n 125,112\n 16,648\n \n 29\n \n 29\n 2\n 2\n \n 29\n \n 419\n 232\n  (2,136)\n –\n 28,163\n  (4,738)\n \n  (1,264)\n  (1,764)\n 59,512\n \n 36,831\n 1,884\n \n 1,252\n –\n (2,123)\n \n (413)\n 338\n 37,769\n \n 709\n –\n  (9,454)\n  (64,854)\n –\n –\n \n 1,337\n  (4,953)\n 64,545\n \n 102,520\n 29,729\n \n 1,800\n 4,747\n (20,242)\n \n (1,287)\n 7,845\n 125,112\n \n Total\n 162,881\n 19,479\n \n 1,128\n 232\n  (11,590)\n  (64,854)\n 28,163\n  (4,738)\n \n 73\n  (6,717)\n 124,057\n \n 139,351\n 31,613\n \n 3,052\n 4,747\n (22,365)\n \n (1,700)\n 8,183\n 162,881\n \n The amounts included in these Group Financial Statements in respect of the income and \n expenses of associates and joint ventures are taken from their latest financial statements, \n prepared up to their respective year ends, together with management accounts for  \n the intervening periods to the Group’s year end.

Fair value classification levels  \n have been assigned to the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value. The different \n levels assigned are defined as follows:\n \n Level 1:  Prices quoted in active markets\n Level 2:  Valuation techniques based on observable market data\n Level 3:  Valuation techniques based on unobservable input\n \n Risk exposures\n Group risk management\n Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels \n and encompasses different types of risks. This overall Group risk management process \n includes the performance of a risk assessment that is described in more detail in note 34. \n Financial risk management specifically is described in further detail below.\n \n Financial risk management\n The Group’s international operations expose it to different financial risks that include:\n –  credit risks,\n liquidity risks,\n – \n foreign exchange rate risks,\n – \n interest rate risks, and \n – \n –  commodity price risks. \n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 110\n \n Notes to the Group Financial Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n The Group has a risk management programme in place, which seeks to limit the impact \n of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. The Board has determined \n the policies for managing these risks. It is the policy of the Board to manage these risks \n in a non-speculative manner.\n  \n Credit risk\n Exposure to credit risk\n Credit risk arises from credit issued to customers on outstanding receivables and  \n outstanding transactions, as well as cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial  \n instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n \n Trade and other receivables\n The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics \n of each customer. There is no concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual \n customers or geographically.\n \n The Group has detailed procedures for monitoring and managing the credit risk related \n to its trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default \n rates. Individual risk limits are generally set by customer, and risk is only accepted above \n such limits in defined circumstances. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. \n Impairment provisions are used to record impairment losses, unless the Group is satisfied \n that no recovery of the amount owing is possible. At that point the amount is considered \n irrecoverable and is written off directly against the trade receivable.\n \n The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred \n losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components \n of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant \n exposures and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets  \n in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.\n \n The Group also manages credit risk through the use of a receivables purchase arran-\n gement with a financial institution. Under the terms of this non-recourse agreement,  \n the Group has transferred credit risk and control of certain trade receivables, amounting  \n to €38,705,000 (2010: €30,373,000). The Group has continued to recognise an  \n asset of €680,000 (2010: €483,000) representing the maximum extent of its continuing \n involvement and an associated liability of a similar amount.\n \n Cash and short-term bank deposits \n Cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest  \n short-term credit rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions  \n at any one time. \n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 111\n \n Notes to the Group Financial Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n Exposure to credit risk\n The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions, represents the \n Group’s maximum credit exposure.

In \n order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document the relationship \n between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument and demonstrate, at incep-\n tion, that the hedge relationship will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. The hedge \n relationship must be tested for effectiveness on subsequent reporting dates.\n \n There is no significant difference between the timing of the cash flows and the income \n statement effect of cash flow hedges.\n  \n Market risk\n Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices and indices, such as foreign  \n exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its  \n holdings of financial instruments.  \n \n Foreign exchange risk\n In addition to the Group’s operations carried out in eurozone economies, it also has  \n significant operations in the UK, Switzerland and North America. As a result, the Group \n Balance Sheet is exposed to currency fluctuations including, in particular, sterling,  \n US dollar, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc movements. The Group manages its balance \n sheet having regard to the currency exposures arising from its assets being denominated \n in a wide range of currencies. \n \n Net investment hedges\n As part of its approach towards mitigating its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group \n will, when required, fund foreign currency assets in the currency of the related assets. \n \n These relationships are typically designated by the Group as net investment hedges of \n foreign currency exposures on net investments in foreign operations using the borrowings \n as the hedging instrument. These hedge designations allow the Group to mitigate the \n risk of foreign currency exposures on the carrying amount of net assets in foreign  \n operations in its Group Financial Statements. \n \n The borrowings designated in net investment hedge relationships are measured at fair \n value with the effective portion of the change in value of the borrowings being recognised \n directly through equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. Any ineffectiveness \n arising on such hedging relationships is recognised immediately in the income statement. \n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 115\n \n Notes to the Group Financial Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n Currency swaps\n The Group also hedges a portion of its transactional currency exposure through the use \n of currency swaps. Transactional exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating \n unit in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. The Group requires its \n operating units to use forward currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures on \n certain foreign currency purchases. The forward currency contracts must be in the  \n same currency and match the settlement terms of the hedged item.\n \n The following table details the Group’s exposure to transactional foreign currency risk at \n the balance sheet date:\n \n USD\n 1,380\n 55\n 1,606\n (9,055)\n (180)\n \n (877)\n (7,071) \n \n CAD\n 6,310\n 56\n 3,004\n (4,482)\n (2,168)\n \n –\n  2,720 \n \n CHF\n 1,764\n –\n 9\n (813)\n (638)\n \n 42\n  364 \n \n EUR\n 8,817\n 215\n 10,255\n (24,186)\n (1,778)\n \n (474)\n (7,151) \n \n Other\n 1,972\n  46\n 251\n (56)\n –\n \n –\n  2,213 \n \n Total\n 23,577\n 372\n 19,609\n (42,663)\n (5,119)\n \n (1,220)\n (5,444) \n \n The following table details the Group’s exposure to transactional foreign currency risk at \n 31 July 2010.\n \n USD\n 1,238\n 101\n 2,035\n (3,681)\n –\n \n (946)\n (1,253)\n \n CAD\n 3,785\n 2\n 1,676\n (1,680)\n (1,563)\n \n 268\n 2,488\n \n CHF\n 1,005\n 37\n 430\n (757)\n (417)\n \n (424)\n (126)\n \n EUR\n 26,087\n –\n 2,971\n (20,127)\n (3,698)\n \n (554)\n 4,679\n \n Other\n 1,630\n 48\n 73\n (78)\n –\n \n –\n 1,673\n \n Total\n 37,955\n 188\n 13,770\n (31,795)\n (10,702)\n \n (2,687)\n (6,729)\n \n GBP\n 3,334\n –\n 4,484\n (4,071)\n (355)\n \n 89\n  3,481 \n \n GBP\n 4,210\n –\n 6,585\n (5,472)\n (5,024)\n \n (1,031)\n (732)\n \n 2011\n in Euro `000\n Trade receivables\n Other receivables\n Bank\n Trade payables\n Other payables\n Derivative financial \n \n instruments\n \n At 31 July 2011\n \n 2010\n in Euro `000\n Trade receivables\n Other receivables\n Bank\n Trade payables\n Other payables\n Derivative financial \n \n instruments\n \n At 31 July 2010\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 116\n \n Notes to the Group Financial Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n Currency sensitivity analysis \n A 10 % strengthening or weakening of the euro against the following currencies at 31 July \n 2011 would have increased / (decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown \n below.

As part of the Plan restructuring, the Trustees purchased annuities for the Plan’s \n existing pensioners. This extinguished the Group’s liability in the Plan relating to those \n pensioners.

Benefit changes were implemented and in the case of the Origin  \n scheme the Origin Group ceased its liability to contribute to the scheme with effect  \n from 16 December 2009 and agreed to increase the transfer values payable from  \n the plan on wind-up to one hundred percent of the transfer values under the Minimum \n Funding Standard excluding any allowance for pension increases. These proposed \n payments were recorded as a liability at 31 July 2010 of which €9,847,000 has been \n paid during the current financial year. The impact of the changes is to reduce the \n pension liabilities in the Group Balance Sheet and the related volatility. \n \n Under IAS 19, Employee Benefits, the total deficit in the Group’s defined benefit plans, \n including the main plan, outlined above, for which Origin is the principal employer,  \n at 31 July 2011 was €12,109,000 (2010: €11,828,000). The pension cost recorded in \n the Income Statement for the year in respect of the Group’s defined benefit plans was \n €3,475,000 (2010: charge of €3,308,000). The estimated contributions expected to be \n paid during the year ending 31 July 2012 in respect of the Group’s defined benefit  \n plans is €3,606,000. \n \n A charge of €9,074,000 (2010: €4,335,000) was recorded in respect of the Group’s \n defined contribution plans.\n \n Long-term employee benefits included in the Group Balance Sheet comprises the \n following:\n \n 2011\n 6,851\n 5,258\n 12,109\n 3,917\n 16,026\n \n in Euro `000\n Deficit in ARYZTA Food Group defined benefit plans\n Deficit in Origin defined benefit plans\n Total deficit in defined benefit plans\n Other1\n Total\n 1 \n  \n  \n The valuations of the defined benefit plans used for the purposes of the following disclosures \n are those of the most recent actuarial valuations to 31 July 2011 by an independent, \n qualified actuary.

The Group has formal risk assessment processes in  \n place through which risks and mitigating controls are evaluated. These processes are \n driven by management of the businesses, who are best placed to identify the significant  \n on-going and emerging risks facing their businesses. The outputs of these risk  \n assessment processes are subject to various levels of review by management, and a \n consolidated Risk Map is reviewed by the ARYZTA Board of Directors on an annual  \n basis. Risks identified and associated mitigating controls are also subject to audit as part \n of operational, financial and health and safety audit programmes.\n \n Accounting estimates and judgements\n \n 35 \n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management  \n to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting \n policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.\n \n In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical \n judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the \n amount recognised in the financial statements are described below:\n \n Note\n Note 8\n Note 14\n \n Note 22\n Note 24\n Note 25\n \n Name\n Share-based payments\n Goodwill and intangible assets – measurement of the recoverable amounts of\n CGUs\n Financial instruments and financial risk\n Deferred tax\n Retirement benefit obligations\n \n The Group has grants of share-based incentives outstanding under various incentive \n plans. Estimating the value of these grants, and the period over which this value will be \n recognised as an expense, requires various management estimates and assumptions, \n as set out in note 8. \n \n Impairment testing of assets, particularly of goodwill, involves estimating the future cash \n flows for a cash-generating unit and an appropriate discount rate to determine a recoverable \n value, as set out in note 14. \n \n The Group Balance Sheet includes deferred tax assets of €79,073,000 relating  \n to deductible differences and, in certain cases, deferred tax assets related to tax loss \n carry-forwards of €34,597,000 provided that their utilisation appears reasonable.  \n The recoverable value is based on forecasts of the corresponding taxable Group company  \n over a period of several years. As actual results may differ from these forecasts, the \n deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted accordingly.\n \n The estimation of employee benefit costs requires the use of actuaries and the  \n determination of appropriate assumptions such as discount rates and expected future \n rates of return, as set out in note 25.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 134\n \n Notes to the Group Financial Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n Significant subsidiaries\n \n 36 \n A list of all of the Group’s significant subsidiary undertakings as at 31 July 2011 is  \n provided in the table below.

Those standards \n require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether  \n the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. \n \n An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and \n disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend  \n on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement \n of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those \n risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s  \n preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design \n audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of \n expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit \n also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the \n reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation \n of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have \n obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n \n Opinion\n In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2011 \n give a true and fair view of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash \n flows in accordance with IFRS and comply with Swiss law.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n Group Financial Statements\n \n 137\n \n Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated \n Financial Statements to the General Meeting \n (continued)\n \n Report on Other Legal Requirements\n We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor \n Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that \n there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.\n \n In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard \n 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the \n preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the \n Board of Directors.\n \n We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.\n \n PricewaterhouseCoopers AG\n \n Patrick Balkanyi \n Audit Expert   \n Auditor in Charge\n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n Cornelia Ritz Bossicard\n Audit Expert \n \n Zurich, 22 September 2011\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 138\n \n Company Income Statement\n for the year ended 31 July 2011\n \n in CHF `000 \n Income\n Revenues from licences and management fees\n Financial income\n Dividend income\n Gain on sale of IP asset\n Total income\n \n Expenses\n Depreciation and amortisation\n Personnel expenses\n Financial expenses\n Other operating expenses\n Total expenses\n \n Profit / (loss) before taxes\n Taxes\n \n Net profit / (loss) after taxes\n \n 2011\n \n 2010\n \n 32,693\n 37,900\n 80,378\n 113,000\n 263,971\n \n 35,456\n 20,953\n –\n –\n 56,409\n \n (49,622)\n (4,381)\n (137,608)\n (15,980)\n (207,591)\n \n (49,536)\n (2,673)\n (44,468)\n (15,722)\n (112,399)\n \n 56,380\n 2,528\n \n (55,990)\n (2,172)\n \n 58,908\n \n (58,162)\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 139\n \n Company Balance Sheet \n as at 31 July 2011\n \n in CHF `000 \n Assets\n Non-current assets\n Property, plant and equipment\n Intangible assets\n Financial assets\n  – investments\n  – loans to Group companies\n Total non-current assets\n \n Current assets\n Cash and cash equivalents\n Other receivables\n  – from third parties\n  – from Group companies\n Deferred expenses and accrued income\n Total current assets\n \n Total assets\n \n 2011\n \n 2010\n \n 1,640\n 72,844\n \n 1,114\n 121,431\n \n  1,380,485 \n  1,139,404 \n  2,594,373 \n \n 1,318,546\n 863,051\n 2,304,142\n \n  42,201 \n \n 40,056\n \n  1,038 \n  805 \n –\n 44,044\n \n 537\n 39,245\n 394\n 80,232\n \n  2,638,417 \n \n 2,384,374\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 140\n \n Company Balance Sheet (continued)\n as at 31 July 2011\n \n in CHF `000 \n Equity\n Called up share capital\n Legal reserves from capital contribution\n Unrestricted reserves\n Legal reserves for own shares from capital contribution\n Loss carried forward\n Net profit / (loss) for the year\n Total equity\n \n Liabilities\n Non-current liabilities\n Provisions\n Intercompany non-current liabilities\n Interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n Total non-current liabilities\n \n Current liabilities\n Trade accounts payable\n Accrued expenses and deferred income\n Interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n Other accounts payable\n  – to third parties\n  – to Group companies\n Total current liabilities\n \n Total liabilities\n \n Total equity and liabilities\n \n 2011\n \n 2010\n \n  1,701 \n  159,316 \n  983,610 \n  75,167 \n (124,022)\n  58,908 \n  1,154,680 \n \n 1,701\n 159,316\n 1,023,411\n 75,167\n (65,860)\n (58,162)\n 1,135,573\n \n 5,190 \n 377,874\n 925,873 \n 1,308,937\n \n 5,190\n 395,985\n 756,080\n 1,157,255\n \n 2,546 \n 28,135 \n 129,224 \n \n 279 \n 14,616\n 174,800 \n \n 7,230\n 10,205\n 33,412\n \n 425\n 40,274\n 91,546\n \n 1,483,737\n \n 1,248,801\n \n 2,638,417 \n \n 2,384,374\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 141\n \n Notes to the Company Financial Statements\n \n Accounting dates\n \n 1 \n The Company’s accounting period runs for the year from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011. \n \n 2 \n Loans, guarantees and pledges in favour of third parties\n The Company is party to cross guarantees on ARYZTA AG (excluding Origin) Group \n borrowings.\n \n The Company has guaranteed the liabilities of certain of its subsidiaries.

Executives are remunerated in line with \n the level of their authority and responsibility within the Group with the various elements \n of the remuneration package for Executive Management being reviewed annually by the \n NRC. \n \n The NRC reports to the Board at each Board meeting next succeeding each meeting of \n the NRC. The CEO attends meetings of the NRC by invitation only.\n \n Executive Management Basic Salary and Benefits\n The basic salary of Executive Management is reviewed annually by the NRC with regard \n to personal performance and corporate goals. When reviewing Executive Managements’ \n basic salary, the applicable weighting of each component is at the discretion of the NRC. \n Employment related benefits consist principally of a car allowance and pension. Pension \n benefits are determined solely in relation to basic salary.\n \n Executive Management Short-term Performance Related Bonus\n To date, the annual short-term performance related bonus has been determined based \n on personal performance and delivery of the annual ARYZTA Group budget. When \n determining Executive Managements’ short-term performance related bonus, the \n applicable weighting of each component is at the discretion of the NRC. It is the NRC’s \n policy that the short-term performance related bonus does not exceed 100% of basic  \n salary for executive management. For the financial year 2012, the annual bonus will be  \n determined by reference to incremental gains in ARYZTA Food Group ROIC.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 145\n \n Notes to the Company Financial Statements \n (continued)\n \n Executive Management Long-term Incentives (LTIP)\n The long-term incentive remuneration of Executive Management consist of both Matching \n Plan and Option Equivalent Plan awards. The costs of these awards are accrued to each \n member of Executive Management based on the accounting principles applicable to \n share-based payments under IFRS 2, Share-based Payment. Over the last three years \n the average long-term incentive cost attributable to individual members of Executive \n Management has ranged between 171% and 292% of basic salary. See note 8 of the \n Group Financial Statements for the total cost recognised in the Group Financial Statements \n for share-based payments in the financial year 2011.\n \n During the prior financial year, the Company made awards under the Share Option \n Equivalent Plan LTIP to Executive Management and to Group Management. The vesting \n of the share options equivalents granted is conditional on the growth rate in underlying \n fully diluted EPS in any three consecutive accounting periods exceeding the growth in the \n Euro zone Core Consumer Price Index plus 5 %. In addition, the return on invested capital \n over the relevant three year performance period must not be less than the weighted  \n average cost of capital of the Group, and the individual must be in on-going employment. \n The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the option \n equivalents in cash. The cost of the Share Option Equivalent Plan LTIP is charged to the \n Income Statement over the current estimated vesting period from grant date. \n \n During the financial year 2010 and the financial year 2011, the Company made no new \n awards under the Matching Plan LTIP. Participants with Matching Plan Awards have \n the prospect of receiving up to three shares for each recognised qualifying interest held \n throughout the performance period. Vesting is determined by reference to underlying fully \n diluted EPS growth. Compound growth in EPS in any three consecutive financial years \n ending after 31 July 2008 must exceed 10 %, with vesting accruing as per the  \n following table:\n \n EPS growth \n 15 % or more\n >12.5 % < 15 %\n 10 % to 12.4 %\n < 10 %\n \n Multiple  \n (re-qualifying in- \n vestment shares)\n 3\n 2\n 1\n 0\n \n Awards under the Matching Plan are subject to additional conditions including  \n notably: (a) the requirement to hold recognised qualifying interests throughout the  \n performance period; and (b) the requirement that ARYZTA’s return on invested capital  \n over the performance period is not less than its weighted average cost of capital. \n \n The cost of the Matching Plan LTIP is charged to the Income Statement over the  \n estimated vesting period. The fair value assigned to these equity instruments represents \n the full value of an ordinary share on the date of grant, adjusted for lost dividends  \n between the date of issue and the vesting date.\n \n \fAryztA AG  Accounts 2011\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 146\n \n Notes to the Company Financial Statements \n (continued)\n \n Compensation to members of the Board of Directors\n Non-executive Board members are paid a yearly fee which reflects the time commitment \n and responsibilities of the role. Additional compensation is payable for service on a  \n Board Committee (including the Chair thereof).

The Board of Directors is further respon-\n sible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting \n estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n \n Auditor’s Responsibility\n Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our  \n audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. \n Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  \n assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. \n \n An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts  \n and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the \n auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the \n financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments,  \n the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of  \n the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in  \n the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness  \n of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriate-\n ness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \n made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe \n that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a  \n basis for our audit opinion.\n \n Opinion\n In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2011 comply with \n Swiss law as well as with the Company’s articles of incorporation.\n  \n \n \fAryztA AG  Annual Report 2011\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 151\n \n Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Financial \n Statements to the General Meeting of ARYZTA AG\n (continued)\n \n Report on Other Legal Requirements\n We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor \n Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that \n there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.\n \n In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard \n 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the \n preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of \n Directors.\n \n We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with \n Swiss law and the Company’s articles of incorporation.

Revenue growth in Food \n North America was largely organic driven, while acquisition growth led gains in Food \n Europe. Growth in the Rest of World segment was mainly organic, however acquisitions  \n in South East Asia benefited top-line performance. Favourable currency translation  \n rates assisted performance during the year, as the euro, ARYZTA’s reporting currency, \n remained under pressure. \n \n During the year, good progress on margin expansion was achieved, with Food Group \n margins increasing by 60bps to 13.1%. This improvement reflected the focus on change \n and reorganisation achieved through the ongoing implementation of the ARYZTA \n Transformation Initiative (‘ATI’). Further progress can be expected in FY 2013, as ATI \n remains a critical area of investment for ARYZTA in the years ahead, as well as a \n substantial enabler for the delivery of targets. \n \n In addition to the ongoing investment in ATI, ARYZTA commenced investment in new \n capacity and upgrades in Poland and Malaysia, and completed the new bakery in Brazil \n during the final quarter of 2012. Acquisitions included Honeytop in the UK, a leading \n manufacturer of flat breads. The addition of Honeytop adds new product capabilities, \n new customers and broadens ARYZTA’s channel to market in Europe, which has a high \n dependency on independents. In South East Asia, two bakeries were acquired that \n manufacture for leading limited serve restaurant (‘LSR’) customers, which will facilitate \n further growth and investment in this region. \n \n Similar to FY 2011, input cost volatility also occurred during FY 2012. This volatility \n triggered price increases during H1 2012, which waned during Q3 2012. However,  \n cereal prices then increased significantly during Q4, due to weather-related events in key \n global grain-producing regions. This resulted in food inflation pressures re-emerging as  \n a business issue. ARYZTA continues to manage this risk, mitigating its impact on customers \n and food affordability, while maintaining quality and service levels. The outlook for input \n costs remains volatile.\n \n In January 2012, ARYZTA offered an equity share placement (5% of the pre-existing \n shares issued). This issuance raised €140.9m, net of costs, and has substantially \n strengthened the balance sheet, leaving the Group well positioned for growth. This  \n significantly assisted the delivery of a year-end net debt: EBITDA of 2.05x (excluding \n hybrid), which maintained investment-grade status and helped offset the negative  \n translation impact of the Group’s dollar debt holdings.\n \n Results\n ARYZTA’s financial year was a challenging one. Trading conditions were difficult, with \n persistent input price inflation in H1, a subdued consumer spending environment and \n increased government austerity measures in Europe. However, the Food Group performed \n well, reporting 3.8% growth in underlying revenue, 60bps increase in margins to 13.1% \n and a 16.3% increase in EBITA.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 4\n \n Letter to Shareholders (continued)\n \n The Group posted a solid earnings performance for the financial year 2012, with  \n underlying fully diluted net profit increasing by 11.9% to €291m, while underlying fully \n diluted earnings increased by 8.8% to 337.5 cent, reflecting the increased weighted \n average number of shares in issue following the January placement.\n \n Dividend\n The Board recommends a final dividend of CHF 0.61251 per share, to be paid on  \n 1 February 2013, if approved at the Annual General Meeting on 11 December 2012.\n \n Board membership\n At the 2011 AGM, held on 1 December 2011, shareholders confirmed the re-election of \n Mr. J. Brian Davy and Mr. Patrick McEniff (CFO) to the Board of Directors, each for a \n further three-year term of office. In addition, Mr. Götz-Michael Müller, Mr. Shaun B. \n Higgins and Mr. Hugh Cooney were elected as new members of the Board of Directors, \n each for a three-year term. The biographies of individual Board members are available on \n pages 34 to 37 in the Corporate Governance report.\n \n Dr. J. Maurice Zufferey and Mr. Denis Buckley, whose terms of office expired at the 2011 \n AGM, did not stand for re-election. We would like to take the opportunity to thank them \n and pay tribute to their service to ARYZTA as members of the Board of Directors.\n \n The Board of ARYZTA AG now consists of two executive directors and eight non- \n executive directors. \n \n Acknowledgement\n On behalf of the Board, we would like to acknowledge the talent, hard work and commitment \n of ARYZTA’s management and staff. This is an everyday business and our people are  \n the inspiration to excellence every day.

Speciality bakery consists of freshly prepared offerings giving \n the best value, variety, taste and convenience to consumers at the point of sale. ARYZTA’s \n customer channels consist of a mix of convenience and independent retail, large retail, \n limited serve restaurants (‘LSR’) and other foodservice categories.\n \n Total Food Group revenue grew by 11.3% to €2.9bn. ARYZTA’s underlying Food business \n performed well, posting underlying revenue growth of 3.8% in what was a very a challenging \n trading environment, particularly in the Food Europe segment. \n \n Food EBITA increased by 16.3%, while EBITA margins expanded by 60bps to 13.1%, \n reflecting the improved efficiencies being derived through ARYZTA’s Transformation \n Initiative (‘ATI’). This translated into a 13.1% increase in underlying net profit within the \n Food Group.\n \n Food Europe\n \n 6 \n Food Europe has leading market positions in the European speciality bakery market. It \n has a diversified customer base including convenience retail, gas stations, multiple retail, \n restaurants, catering and hotels, leisure and LSR. \n \n Food Europe revenue grew by 7.5% to €1.3bn, with currency modestly boosting reported \n revenue by 1.5%. The contribution from acquisitions of 7.0% was somewhat offset  \n by a decline in underlying revenues of 1.0%, reflecting weak consumer spending and the \n growing impact of government austerity measures across the region. These macro- \n economic factors reinforced the continuing trend of consumers switching channels from \n independent convenience towards large retail and LSR. \n \n The growth in Food Europe was primarily acquisition-driven reflecting the acquisition  \n of Honeytop in the UK in August 2011. Honeytop primarily manufactures flat breads and \n supplies both large retail and LSR customers. \n \n During the year, further investment in expanding and upgrading facilities in Poland \n commenced, which is aimed at meeting increased demand from European LSR \n customers. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 14\n \n Financial and Business Review (continued)\n \n EBITA increased by 13.7% to €169.5m due to the benefit of ATI measures and changes \n in the food offering. This also led to EBITA margins expanding by 70bps, versus FY 2011, \n to 13.3%.\n \n Throughout the year, macro-economic conditions remained challenging. This was not \n confined solely to Ireland and the UK, as the euro financial crisis continued to impact \n government spending and consumer sentiment across the European continent. In  \n this context, the relative performance of the Food Europe segment remained robust. \n \n Food North America\n \n 7 \n Food North America is a leading player in the US speciality bakery market. It has a \n diversified customer base, including multiple retail, restaurants, catering and hotels, \n leisure, hospitals, military, fundraising and LSRs. ARYZTA is the leader in high value artisan \n bakery via La Brea Bakery, which focuses on the premium bakery segment. ARYZTA’s \n well established partnerships with key global LSR customers, which dominate the North \n American convenience food landscape, position the Group to grow market share in \n tandem with customer growth.\n \n Food North America revenue grew by 13.2% to €1.4bn, with acquisition contribution  \n of 2.1% and underlying revenue growth of 7.0%. Favourable currency movements \n benefited the reported performance in the year by 4.1%.The underlying organic growth  \n in North America was very strong, reflective of progress on deepening customer  \n relationships and increased availability of a broader range of products to North American \n customers. The performance also benefited from stronger consumer spending trends  \n in North America compared to Europe.\n \n EBITA grew by 18.6% to €176.3m due to positive underlying revenue growth and good \n margin expansion. Margins expanded by 50bps to 12.8% during the year, benefiting  \n from progress on the recovery of raw material costs, ongoing efficiencies and revenue \n growth arising from the ATI programme. \n \n Food North America is well advanced in terms of operating on a single ERP platform. \n Further work will take place during FY 2013 to leverage this investment and increase \n returns. During the year, new executive management and refocused sales teams have \n been appointed. The objectives driving these changes remains delivering improved \n customer centric metrics and leveraging growth opportunities in the region through \n increased sales penetration levels.\n \n Food Rest of World \n \n 8 \n ARYZTA operates in Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Japan. During the year, \n businesses in Singapore and Taiwan were also added. These acquisitions performed \n satisfactorily and to expectation.\n \n Food Rest of World revenues grew by 23.0% to €221.5m, with acquisition contribution of \n 7.0% and underlying revenue growth of 13.0%. Favourable currency benefited reported \n growth by 3.0%.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 15\n \n Financial and Business Review (continued)\n \n EBITA grew by 18.0% to €29.0m, while EBITA margins declined by 60bps to 13.1%. This \n was largely due to the impact of transportation costs to Brazil during the year, to meet \n demand while additional capacity was being commissioned. The new facility became fully \n operational in Q4, which should assist margin progress, as these FY 2012 transport costs \n will not re-occur in FY 2013. Additional investment also commenced in Malaysia during \n the year and is expected to be operational during FY 2013. \n \n The key driver of revenue growth and capacity expansion in this region remains ARYZTA’s \n partnership with global LSR groups, which should underpin the Group’s future growth \n prospects in this region.\n \n 9 \n Food Group Non-Recurring Items & Strategic Repositioning\n Non-recurring costs were incurred during the year, as a result of ATI initiatives aimed  \n at improving focus on the customer and on more efficient manufacturing. These  \n non-recurring costs amounted to €83.5m during the year ending July 2012, as follows:\n \n in EUR `000 \n Net gain on acquisition, disposals and dilution\n Transaction related costs\n Asset write-downs and fair value adjustments\n Severance and other staff related costs\n Other costs arising on integration\n Total income statement impact\n \n Non-cash\n  1,417  \n  – \n  (7,750) \n  – \n  – \n  (6,333) \n \n Cash\n  – \n  (1,804) \n  – \n  (50,639) \n  (24,701) \n  (77,144) \n \n Total\n  1,417  \n  (1,804) \n  (7,750) \n  (50,639) \n  (24,701) \n  (83,477) \n \n The bulk of the non-recurring costs were incurred in the second half of FY 2012, 82%  \n in H2 versus 18% in H1. The non-cash costs of €6.3m related to the closure of sites \n during the financial year. The €77.1m cash costs incurred during the year related to \n severance and site decommissioning costs, as well as contractual obligations and \n advisory costs, with 66% related to severance and decommissioning and 22% to  \n contractual and advisory.\n \n ARYZTA Transformation Initiative \n \n 10 \n Following on from the phased implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (‘ERP’) \n throughout the business during FY 2010 and FY 2011, the ARYZTA Transformation \n journey will continue to advance in FY 2013 with additional investment planned, especially \n in Europe. By the end of FY 2012, SAP was operating live in Food North America, with \n further work ongoing to leverage its full potential and return on investment. Rolling out \n SAP in Food Europe remains a key focus for FY 2013.\n \n ARYZTA is continuing with its ongoing €400m investment strategy in its existing businesses. \n This is aimed at supply chain optimisation, SAP implementation throughout the Food \n business and upgrading its manufacturing footprint to fewer, larger, more efficient multi- \n product bakeries. The benefits of this investment remain a key driver of ARYZTA’s goal to \n improve its ROIC to 15%+, from FY 2011 underlying food assets, by FY 2015. Further \n capacity reorganisation and investment will continue to occur during the coming financial \n year. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 16\n \n Financial and Business Review (continued)\n \n During the year, new executive management teams in Europe and North America were \n appointed to drive the ATI initiative. Alongside this, the Food Group has seen a refocus of \n its sales team to meet the unique channel requirements in which ARYZTA operates, and  \n to enhance a culture of innovation. This has translated into increased customer marketing \n capability, especially in North America, as ARYZTA becomes more customer centric \n focused on offering its full food portfolio to all customers. ARYZTA views ATI as key to \n improving competitiveness as Food North America and Food Europe move to a single \n instance ERP operational platform. \n \n Primary food inflation\n \n 11 \n A key feature and risk management task for ARYZTA during FY 2012 was to manage \n volatile raw material prices. During FY 2012, especially in H1, agricultural raw material \n inflation triggered the need for price increases. While inflationary pressures abated \n somewhat in Q3, they resurfaced in Q4 as drought hit hard in key grain producing regions \n of the world, causing prices to spike. ARYZTA uses a range of tools to deal with this key \n business risk. In this regard ARYZTA continues to work closely with customers to mitigate \n the impact of pricing on the consumer through product innovation, selection and service \n model efficiencies. The outlook for food raw materials continues to be volatile and is  \n expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.\n \n Financial position \n \n 12 \n ARYZTA’s 68.8% subsidiary and separately listed company, Origin, has separate funding \n structures, which are financed without recourse to ARYZTA. Origin’s net debt amounted to \n €67.8m at 31 July 2012. \n \n The consolidated net debt of the Food Group, excluding Origin’s non-recourse debt, \n amounts to €976.3m. The Food Group net debt: EBITDA ratio is 2.05x (excluding hybrid \n instrument as debt) and interest cover of 8.10x (excluding hybrid interest). The weighted \n average maturity of the Food Group gross term debt is circa 5.94 years. ARYZTA \n intends to maintain an investment grade position in the range of 2x–3x net debt to \n EBITDA. \n \n In November 2011, ARYZTA agreed an amendment to its existing revolving credit facility, \n which increased the facility from CHF 600m to CHF 970m and extended the maturity  \n of the facility by two years to December 2016 with unchanged interest rate margins and \n financial covenants. This also added new credit providers to complement recent  \n geographic expansion of the ARYZTA business. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 17\n \n Financial and Business Review (continued)\n \n In January 2012, ARYZTA offered an equity share placement (5% of the pre-existing shares \n issued).

ARYZTA has a holding of 95m shares in Origin (68.8% \n holding).\n \n Origin reported financial and operating results in line with expectations for the year.  \n The Board of Origin has proposed a dividend per ordinary share of 15.0 cent for the year \n ended 31 July 2012. \n \n Origin’s separately published results, which were released on 19 September 2012, are \n available at www.originenterprises.com.  \n \n Outlook\n \n 17 \n The economic outlook for developed markets remains extremely challenging, particularly \n in Europe where financial market difficulties and government austerity measures  \n continue to subdue consumer sentiment. Food inflation pressures have re-emerged as \n a business issue and ARYZTA will work closely with its customers to manage the impact \n of these inflationary pressures on affordability, without compromising quality or service \n levels.\n \n ARYZTA’s strategy to deal with this challenging market environment is through its ATI \n programme. ARYZTA will leverage key customer relationships to grow revenue, by  \n focusing on product development around consumer insights and to identify cost  \n efficiencies across the organisation.\n \n ARYZTA has delivered an underlying fully diluted EPS compound annual growth of \n 13.7% since 2008, largely due to repositioning acquisitions. While this is lower than \n the 15% targeted in 2008, this target assumed 50% of the growth would be generated \n organically, which has not materialised due to weaker economic growth and consumer \n spending since 2009.\n \n The current year, FY 2013, will be a further year of reorganisation and transformation. \n The Group expects to report year-on-year underlying fully diluted EPS growth of 5-10% \n in line with FY 2012. The ATI programme is targeting a 15% return from underlying food \n assets by 2015.\n \n 1 \n \n  Based on EUR 0.5063 per share converted at the foreign exchange rate of one EUR to CHF 1.2098  \n on 20 September 2012, the date of the approval of the ARYZTA financial statements.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 22\n \n Financial and Business Review (continued)\n \n Principal risks and uncertainties\n \n 18 \n The Board and senior management have invested significant time and resources in \n identifying specific risks across the Group, and in developing a culture of balanced risk \n minimisation.

In \n addition, the Board re-affirmed its policy that a majority of its membership, excluding  \n the Chairman, shall consist of independent non-executive directors (as determined in \n accordance with the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance).\n \n Compensation Report and ‘Say-on-Pay’ voting\n At the 2011 Annual General Meeting, the shareholders ratified the 2011 Compensation \n Report through a separate advisory vote. In keeping with good corporate governance \n practice, the Board has decided to also submit the 2012 Compensation Report to a separate \n advisory vote of the shareholders at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. The 2012 \n Compensation Report is included on pages 48 to 55 of this Annual Report.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 26\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n ARYZTA Corporate Governance Report format\n The ARYZTA Corporate Governance Report 2012 follows the SIX Swiss Exchange \n Directive on Information Relating to Corporate Governance and takes into account the \n Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance. \n \n The ARYZTA Group consolidated financial statements comply with International Financial \n Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and are in accordance with Swiss law. The ARYZTA AG \n Company financial statements are in accordance with Swiss Law and the Company’s \n Articles of Association. Where necessary, the financial statement disclosures have been \n extended to comply with the requirements of the SIX Swiss Exchange Directive on \n Information Relating to Corporate Governance. \n \n In this report, the terms ‘ARYZTA’ and the ‘Company’ refer to ARYZTA AG, whereas the \n ‘Group’ and the ‘ARYZTA Group’ refer to ARYZTA AG and its subsidiaries. The ‘Board’ \n refers to the Board of Directors of the Company. ‘Origin Enterprises’ means Origin \n Enterprises plc (ARYZTA has a 68.8 % holding in Origin Enterprises plc), and the ‘Origin \n Board’ means the Board of Directors of Origin Enterprises plc. To avoid duplication,  \n in some sections cross-references are made to the 2012 Financial Statements (comprising  \n the Group consolidated financial statements and Company financial statements of \n ARYZTA AG), as well as to the Articles of Association of ARYZTA AG (available on the \n Company website at www.aryzta.com/about-aryzta/corporate-governance.aspx). \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 27\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Group structure and shareholders \n \n 1 \n 1.1  Group structure\n The Group is structured conventionally. The ARYZTA General Meeting is the supreme \n corporate body and the Board is accountable and reports to the shareholders, by whom  \n it is elected. The Board, while entrusted with the ultimate direction of ARYZTA, as well  \n as the supervision and control of management, has delegated responsibility for the day- \n to-day management of the Group, to the extent allowed under Swiss law, through  \n the Chief Executive Officer, to Executive Management. The Group’s management and \n organisational structure corresponds to its segmental reporting lines: Food Europe,  \n Food North America, Food Rest of World and Origin. \n \n Each segment’s management team is responsible for the day-to-day activities of  \n their segments and report to Executive Management, which in turn reports through the \n Chief Executive Officer to the Board. Origin constitutes an exception, as it is a public \n company in its own right, with its own Board of Directors, separate executive management \n team, governance structure and ring-fenced financing arrangements. The executive \n management team within Origin reports to the Origin Board. The Origin Board is accountable \n and reports to its shareholders, including ARYZTA.

Proxies are entitled to attend shareholders’ meetings \n and exercise all rights of the represented shareholders at such meetings.\n \n As indicated previously in paragraph 2.6.2, ARYZTA pursues arrangements with \n Euroclear UK and Ireland to enable investors whose interests in ARYZTA are represented \n by CDIs to exercise their voting rights. CDI holders who wish to be in a position to  \n directly enforce or exercise their rights must have their interests entered in the share  \n register in accordance with Article 7 of the Articles of Association and effectively hold \n their shares through a member of the Swiss SIS Settlement System.\n \n Statutory quorums\n \n 6.2 \n Pursuant to Article 14 of the Articles of Association, resolutions at the General Meeting \n calling for a quorum of at least two-thirds of the votes represented are required for:\n –  The cases listed in art. 704 para. 1 CO and in art. 18 and 64 Merger Act;\n –  The easement or abolition of the restriction of the transferability of registered shares;\n –  The conversion of bearer shares into registered shares; and\n –  Any change to the provisions of article 14 of the Articles of Association.\n \n Convocation of General Meeting of the shareholders\n \n 6.3 \n General Meetings are convened by the Board of Directors and, if need be, by the Auditors. \n Notice of the General Meeting is given by publication in the Swiss Official Gazette of \n Commerce at least 20 days before the date of the meeting. The notice must state, inter \n alia, the day, time and place of the Meeting and the agenda. \n \n Agenda\n \n 6.4 \n The Board states the items on the agenda. One or more registered shareholders who \n jointly represent at least ten percent of the share capital of the Company registered in  \n the Commercial Register may request items to be included in the agenda. Such requests \n must be in writing, specifying the items and the proposals, and be submitted to the \n Chairman at least 45 days before the date of the General Meeting.\n \n  6.5  Entry in the share register\n The relevant date to determine the shareholders’ right to participate in the General \n Meeting on the basis of the registrations appearing in the share register is set by the \n Board in the invitation to the General Meeting.\n \n Change of control and defence measures\n \n 7 \n 7.1  Obligation to make an offer\n ARYZTA does not have a provision on opting out or opting up in the Articles of Association. \n Thus, the provisions regarding the legally prescribed threshold of 33 1/3 % of the voting \n rights for making a public takeover offer set out in art. 32 of the Swiss Stock Exchange \n Act are applicable.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 43\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Change of control clauses\n \n 7.2 \n Benefits under the ARYZTA LTIP vest upon a change of control.

Submissions were received  \n from a number of major accounting firms. The award decision was based on a set of \n criteria which had previously been disclosed to all candidate firms. These criteria \n included such elements as the composition of the audit team, knowledge of the bakery \n industry sector and differentiation vis-à-vis other candidate firms. The ultimate decision \n was made on the basis of general best practice principles. Following a formal tender \n process, PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Zurich, was elected as statutory auditor and Group \n auditor in December 2009. The term of office is one year. Patrick Balkanyi has been  \n the lead auditor since PricewaterhouseCoopers AG’s appointment in 2009. At the 2011 \n AGM, PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Zurich, was re-elected as statutory auditor and Group \n auditor for the 2012 financial year.\n \n Audit fees\n \n 8.2 \n The total audit and audit-related fees charged by the Group auditors in the 2012  \n financial year amounted to €2,621,000. Of these fees, €299,000 were charged to  \n Origin Enterprises plc.\n \n The total audit and audit-related fees charged by the Group auditors in the 2011  \n financial year amounted to €2,458,000. Of these fees, €288,000 were charged to  \n Origin Enterprises plc.\n \n Additional fees\n \n 8.3 \n The Group’s policy is to manage its relationship with the Group’s external auditor in such \n a way that their independence is maintained. To ensure that this is so, the Board has \n determined limits on the type and scale of non-audit work that can be provided by the \n auditor.\n \n Contracts to the auditor for other non-audit work are deemed to be pre-approved by the \n Audit Committee up to an aggregate limit, within the financial year, of 100% of the audit \n fee for the current year. This is subject to the requirement for all contracts for specific \n pieces of non-audit work with fees exceeding €250,000 being awarded on the basis of \n competitive tendering. Where the awarding of a contract for non-audit work to the auditor \n is to be made, which is likely to increase total fees for non-audit work above this aggregate \n limit in the financial year, the Group Chief Financial Officer notifies the Chairman of the \n Audit Committee in advance of such a contract being awarded. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 44\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Fees for additional services rendered by the auditors to the ARYZTA Group in the financial \n year 2012 totalled €2,182,000 (2011: €2,495,000). The largest portion of these fees \n related to tax return preparation or review in 18 countries, covering more than 100 legal \n entities. Of these fees, €16,000 (2011: €38,000) were charged to Origin Enterprises plc.\n \n Auditor’s remuneration\n in EUR `000\n – Auditor’s remuneration for audit and audit-related services\n – Auditor’s remuneration for tax compliance and related services \n – Auditor’s remuneration for tax consulting services\n – Auditor’s remuneration for advisory services\n \n – Total other fees / Audit and audit-related services\n – Tax consulting or advisory services / Audit and audit-related \n \n services\n \n 2012\n  2,621 \n  1,178 \n  904 \n  100 \n  4,803 \n \n 83%\n \n 38%\n \n 2011\n  2,458 \n  1,131 \n  1,263 \n  101 \n  4,953 \n \n 102%\n \n 55%\n \n Information tools pertaining to the external audit\n \n 8.4 \n PricewaterhouseCoopers presents to the Audit Committee a detailed report on the conduct \n of the 2012 Group consolidated and Company financial statement audits, the findings  \n on significant financial accounting and reporting issues, as well as the findings on the \n Group’s internal control system (ICS).\n \n In 2012, PricewaterhouseCoopers attended four Audit Committee meetings and the Group \n Head of Internal Audit participated in all four Audit Committee meetings. Other members \n of the Group Executive Management attended them as invited. In addition, the Head of \n Internal Audit regularly met with the Chairman of the Audit Committee for interim updates.\n \n The Board of Directors annually reviews the selection of the auditors in order to propose \n their appointment to the Annual General Meeting of ARYZTA. The Audit Committee \n assesses the effectiveness of the work of the auditors in accordance with Swiss law. The \n lead auditor rotates every seven years in accordance with Swiss law.\n \n During meetings of the Audit Committee, audit and non-audit-related fees to be charged \n by PricewaterhouseCoopers during the year are reviewed to mitigate the risk of any \n potential impairment to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ independence. PricewaterhouseCoopers \n monitors its independence throughout the year and confirms its independence to the \n Audit Committee annually.\n \n Investor Communications Policy\n \n 9 \n Guiding principles\n ARYZTA is committed to pursuing an open and consistent communication policy with \n shareholders, potential investors and other interested parties. The objective is to ensure \n that the perception of those parties about the historical record, current performance  \n and future prospects of ARYZTA is in line with management’s assessment of the current \n situation at ARYZTA. The guiding principles of this policy are that ARYZTA gives equal \n treatment to shareholders in equal situations, that any price-sensitive information is \n published in a timely fashion and that the information is provided in a format that is as \n complete, simple, transparent and consistent as possible.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 45\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Methodology\n ARYZTA publishes its first-quarter trading update, half-year results, third-quarter trading \n update and full-year results (including the Annual Report) on the occasion of its quarterly \n announcement cycle (see details on page 46). These quarterly announcements are each \n accompanied by a news release. Additionally, a presentation and conference call, which is \n broadcast live on the internet (webcast) and which anyone can choose to access, \n whether a shareholder or not, are held on a half-yearly basis, or as deemed necessary  \n by the Board. These webcasts can be replayed at any time on the ARYZTA website  \n (www.aryzta.com). An automatic alerting service is also provided through the website. \n This ensures that interested parties can sign-up to be automatically alerted to results and \n events announcements published on the website. ARYZTA also ensures that news \n releases are distributed to major wire and news services. These news releases are also \n made available in the News & Media section of the website immediately after release to \n the SIX Swiss Exchange and ISE Irish Exchange (www.aryzta.com/news-and-media.aspx). \n In this way, the Company utilises its website and ancillary communications infrastructure \n to ensure a rapid and equitable distribution of information for all interested parties. \n \n ARYZTA’s Investor Relations programme for institutional investors is carried out in line \n with the quarterly announcement cycle, with management time allocated accordingly and \n not on an ad-hoc basis. ARYZTA has appointed a dedicated communications officer to \n focus on the management of the communication process with investors and the media, \n and to support ARYZTA’s efforts to strike a balance between the needs of managing a \n business and regular transparent communication with investors. ARYZTA’s policy regarding \n investor meetings (i.e. Group meetings, one-to-one meetings and conference calls) is  \n that these will not be held on an ad-hoc basis. These will be organised following quarterly \n announcements, save as mentioned below. Investors wishing to meet the Group in the \n aftermath of such quarterly announcements should e-mail the Group’s Communications \n Officer (see details on page 46). These investor communications focus either on recently \n announced financial results, recent corporate activity or the longer-term strategy of the \n Group. They do not serve the purpose of disclosing new information that might encourage \n an investment decision.\n \n The Group accepts invitations to investor conferences. Attendance at conferences by the \n Group will be on a planned and agreed basis in advance of its quarterly announcement \n cycle. The Company also communicates with analysts and stockbrokers who follow ARYZTA  \n to facilitate third-party research on the Company. ARYZTA assumes no responsibility  \n for any statements, expectations, or recommendations made by analysts and stockbrokers. \n The Group will communicate to investors at the time of any potentially price-sensitive \n event, such as significant acquisitions and divestments, agreements and alliances.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 46\n \n Corporate Governance Report (continued)\n \n Investor relations contact details\n \n Paul Meade \n Communications Officer\n \n ARYZTA AG \n Talacker 41\n 8001 Zurich\n Switzerland\n Tel: +41 (0) 44 583 42 00\n Fax: +41 (0) 44 583 42 49\n E-mail: info@aryzta.com \n \n Key dates to December 2013\n \n Announcement of the 2012 annual results\n Issue of the 2012 annual report \n First-quarter trading update\n Annual General Meeting 2012\n Payment of dividend \n Announcement of half-year results 2013 \n Third-quarter trading update\n Announcement of the 2013 annual results\n Issue of the 2013 annual report\n First-quarter trading update\n Annual General Meeting 2013\n \n 24 September 2012\n 2 October 2012\n 3 December 2012\n 11 December 2012\n 1 February 2013\n 11 March 2013\n 4 June 2013\n 30 September 2013\n 7 October 2013\n 25 November 2013\n 10 December 2013\n \n \fBRAZIL\n \n Rio de Janeiro\n Jardim Botanico\n \n FOOD REST OF THE WORLD\n \n ARYZTA has \n \n 4 manufacturing centres \n \n operating in Brazil\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 48\n \n Annual Report and Accounts 2012\n Compensation Report\n \n Compensation Report 2012 \n \n Introduction\n ARYZTA’s overriding long-term goal is to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and \n deliver enhanced shareholder value.

ARYZTA’s remuneration tools, in particular the ARYZTA Long-Term \n Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)1, are key instruments in this regard.\n \n As in the prior year, the Board has decided to submit this Compensation Report to a \n separate advisory vote of the shareholders at the ARYZTA 2012 Annual General Meeting.\n \n Part 1 of the Compensation Report explains the remuneration system, focusing on:\n – \n – \n – \n \n the corporate goals pursued by ARYZTA;\n the LTIP as employed in the pursuit of those goals; and\n the cost of the LTIP.\n \n Part 2 of the Compensation Report sets out relevant compensation details for the 2012 \n financial year.\n \n 1  \n \n The ARYZTA Long-Term Incentive Plan refers to both the Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan.  \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 49\n \n Compensation Report (continued)\n \n Compensation Report – Part 1\n Corporate goals\n The LTIP and short-term performance-related bonus are intended to direct and focus \n management’s efforts towards the achievement of ARYZTA’s key corporate goals over  \n the long-term and short-term, respectively, as set by the Board and communicated to the \n market through ARYZTA’s investor relations activities, including the annual report. \n \n –  EPS growth\n  \n \n  In ARYZTA’s July 2008 Prospectus, it set itself the goal, as a primary strategic \n objective, of doubling its earnings base within five years.

The underlying  \n purpose is to support the development of an international business capable of \n sustainable growth and the delivery of significant value for shareholders. This \n imperative is supported through adherence to prudent capital discipline policies.\n \n Shareholder value, capital discipline\n While pursuing 15% compound annual growth in EPS, ARYZTA's policy is to maintain \n investment grade credit status. Capital discipline controls applicable to the LTIP are as \n follows:\n \n –  Reported ROIC, Underlying ROIC and WACC\n  \n \n  The rules governing awards under the LTIP require that the ARYZTA Food Group \n Return on Invested Capital (‘Food Group ROIC’) over the performance period must \n exceed the Food Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital (‘WACC’).\n \n Food Group ROIC for this purpose refers to the ARYZTA Food Group pro forma  \n trailing twelve months earnings before interest tax and amortisation ('TTM EBITA') \n reflecting the full twelve months' contribution from acquisitions, taken as a \n percentage of ARYZTA Food Group net assets. For this purpose, EBITA includes  \n the net profit contribution from joint ventures, and is before interest, tax, non-ERP \n amortisation and before the impact of non-recurring items. Net assets exclude all \n bank debt, cash, cash equivalents and tax-related balances. ROIC is reported  \n to investors in  conjunction with announcement of annual and half-year results and  \n is presented on a Group and segmental basis. As presented on page 19, the Food \n Group ROIC reported for the year ended 31 July 2012 was 10.5% (2011: 10.2%).\n \n In order to compare ROIC on a like-for-like basis, the Group also calculates the Food \n Group Underlying ROIC. This measurement indicator is based on the assets of the \n Food Group business that existed as of 31 July 2011, using currency rates consistent \n with 2011, excluding net assets and historical EBITA levels of acquisitions completed \n after 1 August 2011 and adding back asset impairments (unless recovered once the \n assets are disposed of). Based on these adjustments, the Food Group Underlying \n ROIC for the year ended 31 July 2012 was 11.3%, compared with the Food Group \n 2011 Reported ROIC of 10.2%.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 50\n \n Compensation Report (continued)\n \n WACC is determined as a blend of the Food Group’s deemed cost of capital and \n deemed cost of debt, with each of these components weighted on the basis of the \n Food Group’s debt to equity ratio. WACC is measured annually by an external \n specialist using standard calculation methodology and reported to investors in \n conjunction with the announcement of yearly and half-yearly results. For the year \n ended 31 July 2012, the Food Group pre-tax WACC was 8.0% (2011: 8.0%).\n \n –  Dividend policy \n  \n \n  ARYZTA has adopted the additional vesting condition, applicable to LTIP awards made \n after 31 July 2011, requiring that the Board would continue to recommend, throughout \n the performance period, adherence to ARYZTA dividend policy. ARYZTA dividend \n policy is that the payout ratio is based on 15% of underlying fully diluted EPS. \n \n LTIP as employed in the pursuit of the corporate goals \n To date, ARYZTA has employed the Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan to \n focus pursuit of its corporate goals.\n \n Two parallel plans \n Having the Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan running in parallel gives \n beneficial tension in the pursuit of the corporate goals between the pursuit of EPS growth, \n the driver of returns under the Matching Plan, and the need for long-term share price \n growth. \n \n The Matching Plan \n Participants with Matching Plan awards have the prospect of receiving a multiple (ranging \n from one to three times) of the number of Qualifying Investment Shares held for the \n purposes of the Matching Plan. This multiple is determined on a fractional pro-rata basis \n ranging from one to three based on compound annual underlying fully diluted EPS \n growth between 10.0% and 15.0%. In the event of the minimum 10% growth target not \n being achieved, no awards vest. The satisfaction of additional criteria is also required, \n including compliance with the condition that Food Group reported ROIC must have \n exceeded the Food Group WACC throughout the performance period and the additional \n condition regarding maintenance of the ARYZTA dividend policy. \n \n The Option Equivalent Plan \n Vesting of awards under the Option Equivalent Plan is conditional on compound annual \n growth in underlying fully diluted EPS in three consecutive accounting periods exceeding \n the compound growth in the eurozone Core Consumer Price Index, plus 5 %, on an \n annualised basis. The satisfaction of additional criteria is also required including compliance \n with the condition that Food Group Reported ROIC must have exceeded the Food Group \n WACC throughout the performance period and the additional condition regarding \n maintenance of the ARYZTA dividend policy. \n \n Cost of the LTIP\n The cost of the Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan can be considered in \n accounting and dilutive terms.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 51\n \n Compensation Report (continued)\n \n LTIP – accounting cost \n Awards under the LTIP are equity-settled share-based payments, as defined in IFRS 2, \n Share-based Payment. Note 8 of the Group Financial Statements on page 95 details the \n total cost of €7,065,0001 (2011: €19,063,0001) recognised in relation to share-based \n payments for the financial year 2012. \n \n –  LTIP – dilutive effect and 10% / ten year rule\n  \n \n  Under the LTIP rules, no more than 10% of share capital may be allocated for  \n issue over its ten year life. No awards may be made under the current LTIP after  \n 31 July 2019. \n \n –  LTIP – adoption of additional dilutive control rule\n  \n \n  ARYZTA has supplemented the existing ten year/10% dilutive control rule by  \n the adoption of the additional control that, for the three-year cycle commencing  \n 1 August 2011, not more than 3.0% of share capital should be allocated for  \n issue under the LTIP (all plans).\n \n –  Dilutive effect of LTIP awards outstanding at 31 July 2012\n  \n \n >   The vesting of Matching Plan Awards made during FY 2009 resulted in a total of \n \n 975,000 shares being issued to participants (1.22% of the total number of shares \n in issue at the time of grant or 0.43% per annum over the applicable 3 year \n performance period ending 31 July 2011). \n \n  \n \n >   The vesting and net exercise of all Option Equivalent Plan Awards made during \n \n FY 2010, which remain outstanding at 31 July 2012, would result in a total of \n 264,6392 shares being issued to participants, based on the CHF 48.55 share price \n on 31 July 2012 (0.33% of the total number of shares in issue at the time of  \n grant or 0.12% per annum over the applicable 3 year performance period ending \n 31 July 2012).\n \n  \n \n >   The vesting of all Matching Plan Awards made during FY 2012, which remain \n \n outstanding at 31 July 2012, would result in a total of 750,000 shares being  \n issued to participants (0.89% of the total number of shares in issue at the time of \n grant or 0.31% per annum over the applicable 3 year performance period ending \n 31 July 2014).\n \n  \n \n >   The vesting and net exercise of all Option Equivalent Plan Awards made during \n \n FY 2012, which remain outstanding at 31 July 2012, would result in a total of \n 243,563 shares being issued to participants, based on the CHF 48.55 share price \n on 31 July 2012 (0.29% of the total number of shares in issue at the time of  \n grant or 0.10% per annum over the applicable 3 year performance period ending \n 31 July 2014).\n \n 1  Includes costs of Executive Management and other management participants in the LTIP and costs of  \n \n the Origin Plan.

Accordingly, the performance conditions associated with the  \n Option Plan awards outstanding as of 1 August 2011 were met during FY 2012. As a result, 1,135,000 Option  \n Plan awards (650,000 of which are held by Executive Management) are eligible for vesting, pending  \n Nomination and Remuneration Committee approval.

In the financial year 2012, the short-term bonus was determined exclusively \n by reference to incremental gains in Food Group Underlying ROIC. \n \n Subject to a minimum incremental increase in Underlying ROIC of 50bps being achieved \n during the year, Executive Management and other senior executives throughout the \n Group receive a percentage of their set target bonus based on the corresponding gain in \n Food Group Underlying ROIC. The short-term performance-related bonus for Executive \n Management is capped at 100% of basic salary.\n \n Compensation Report – Part 2\n Compensation process\n The Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board (‘NRC’) is responsible for \n determining the remuneration of executive and non-executive members of the Board and \n for approving the remuneration of other members of senior management upon the \n recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.

This consultation resulted in the NRC and Board:\n \n – \n – \n – \n \n revising the form in which ARYZTA reports to shareholders on remuneration matters;\n introducing additional conditions and terms relating to the LTIP;\n  implementing new criteria applicable to the determination of the annual bonus \n element of Executive Management remuneration; and\n \n –  submitting this compensation report to a separate advisory vote of the shareholders at  \n  \n \n the ARYZTA Annual General Meeting.\n \n Against that background, it was decided not to undertake a benchmarking exercise  \n in relation to Executive Management remuneration (short-term and long-term) during the \n 2012 financial year.\n \n The cost of the long-term element of Executive Management remuneration (i.e. the \n Matching Plan and the Option Equivalent Plan) is controlled through the dilution control \n rules and by the fact that rights generally vest only after accounting for the cost of the \n award (per IFRS 2, Share-based Payment).

The Group has formal risk assessment processes in place through \n which risks and mitigating controls are evaluated. These processes are driven by  \n local management, who are best placed to identify the significant ongoing and emerging \n risks facing the business. The outputs of these risk assessment processes are sub ject  \n to various levels of review by Group management and Internal Audit, and a consolidated \n Risk Map denoting potential frequency, severity and velocity of identified risks, is \n reviewed by the ARYZTA Board of Directors on an annual basis. Risks identified and \n associated mitigating controls are also subject to audit as part of operational, financial  \n and health and safety audit programmes.\n \n The key risks facing the Group include the following:1\n –  As an international Group with substantial operations and interests outside the \n \n eurozone, ARYZTA is subject to the risk of adverse movements in foreign currency \n exchange rates.\n \n –  The Group faces business risks associated with cash and collectables given the  \n \n current curtailment of credit for all businesses.\n \n –  Operational risks facing the Group include issues associated with product \n \n  contamination and general food scares affecting relevant products. \n \n –  Changing dietary trends and the increased emphasis on health and wellness among \n \n consumers present both opportunities and risks for the Group.\n \n –  A further risk to the Group, in common with most companies, is the risk of failure \n \n to address increasing compliance requirements in areas such as health and safety, \n emissions and effluent control. \n \n –  The loss of a significant manufacturing / operational site through natural catastrophe \n \n or act of vandalism represents a risk that could, potentially, have a material impact on \n the Group.\n \n –  Similarly, a significant IT or security system failure could adversely impact on  \n \n operations. \n \n –  The Group faces the challenge of fluctuations in commodity and energy costs. \n –  The Group faces the risk of a decrease in consumer spending in the current  \n \n economic climate.\n \n –  The Group faces the risk of impairment of its various brands and intangibles.\n –  Having grown both organically and through acquisitions, the Group faces risks and \n challenges associated with managing growth, and ensuring that processes around \n acquiring and integrating new businesses are robust.\n \n –  The Group faces risks associated with the potential loss of key management  \n \n – \n \n personnel. \n In the event that the Group breaches a financing covenant it may have to renegotiate \n its facilities resulting in a higher cost of funds for the Group.\n \n –  The loss of a significant supplier as a result of the current economic environment \n \n could adversely impact ongoing operations of the business.\n \n –  As the Group operates in a competitive industry, it is subject to the risk of the loss  \n \n of a significant customer.\n \n –  The implementation of a future Group-wide ERP system requires substantial  \n \n investment, and would result in significant costs in the event of a failed implementation.\n \n 1  These risks are not listed in order of importance.\n \n \fSINGAPORE\n Singapore\n Merlion Park\n \n FOOD REST OF THE WORLD\n \n ARYZTA has \n \n 1 manufacturing centre \n \n operating in\n  Singapore\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 59\n \n Annual Report and Accounts 2012\n Our Responsibility\n \n ARYZTA is committed to building a successful and sustainable business for the long \n term.

The following key pillars of corporate responsibility and sustainability are \n applied by ARYZTA.\n \n Community\n ARYZTA believes in building long-term relationships with its stakeholders, which include \n consumers, customers, employees, shareholders and regulatory bodies. The Group \n understands its responsibilities as an important member of the communities in which it \n operates and emboldens its business units to play an active role within them. As well  \n as providing employment opportunities, the Group aims to make positive contributions  \n to its community, by building relationships and earning a positive reputation as a good \n employer, neighbour and corporate citizen.\n \n With regard to business ethics, ARYZTA expects all commercial dealings by or on behalf \n of the Group to be conducted with integrity and respect for all parties, as well as in \n compliance with local and national legislation.\n \n Workplace\n ARYZTA recognises that its continued success is dependent on the quality, commitment \n and responsible behaviour of its people. It therefore provides clear policies and direction  \n to the management teams of its operating businesses. ARYZTA continues to strive for the \n highest standards in management practices. The Group provides equal opportunities  \n in recruitment, selection, promotion, employee development, training and reward policies \n and procedures. ARYZTA also complies with applicable national laws and industry \n standards on working hours. \n \n Safety is of paramount importance for ARYZTA. It pursues comprehensive internal safety \n management procedures, including policy manuals, verification of regulatory compliance, \n risk assessments, individual site action plans, safety audits, training, formal accident \n investigation and the provision of occupational health services. It also maintains a strong \n focus on the use of key performance indicators, external auditing and achieving exacting \n external health and safety accreditation for its operations. \n \n Marketplace\n To ensure all our food products are manufactured with the highest level of food safety,  \n all of ARYZTA’s food processing facilities operate under comprehensive HACCP-systems \n (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) based on Codex Alimentarius Principles, \n GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) and in compliance with all related food law in force. \n To this end, ARYZTA contributes to various voluntary initiatives on food and product  \n safety by industry associations such as the British Retail Consortium, International Featured \n Standards (IFS-Food and IFS-Logistics), the American Institute of Baking or the US Food \n and Drug Administration. All food safety and quality systems are certified by independent \n third-party bodies in accordance with the latest versions of the above-mentioned standards.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Annual Report 2012\n \n 60\n \n Our Responsibility (continued)\n \n Environment\n ARYZTA is committed to a policy of sustainable economic development.

The following standards and interpretations, issued by the International \n Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee, are effective \n for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group:\n \n –  Amendment to IFRS 7  – Financial Instruments: Disclosures\n –  Amendment to IFRIC 14 –  IAS 19, Limits on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum \n \n Funding Requirements and their Interaction\n \n –  Amendment to IAS 24  – Related Party Disclosures\n \n The above standards and interpretations adopted by the Group in the current year have \n had no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position.\n \n The following new standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or the IFRS \n Interpretations Committee, have not yet become effective.

Based on this initial assessment, the Group does not currently believe \n that the adoption of these standards, amendments and interpretations will have a \n significant impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.\n \n Basis of preparation\n The Group consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, \n except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at fair value: equity investments \n held at fair value through other comprehensive income, certain financial liabilities at  \n fair value through profit or loss, investment properties and derivative financial instruments. \n The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, rounded to the nearest \n thousand, unless otherwise stated. \n \n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management  \n to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the application of the Group’s \n accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical \n experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the  \n circumstances, the results of which form the basis for the judgements about carrying \n values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\n \n The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions \n to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised,  \n if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if \n the revision affects both current and future periods.\n \n Further information on areas involving a higher degree of judgement and accounting \n estimates are set out in note 34.\n \n Income statement presentation\n The Group Consolidated Income Statement is presented by function of expense. Within \n this presentation, net acquisition, disposal and restructuring related costs and fair value \n adjustments are presented as a separate component of operating profit, due to the \n relative size or nature of these items. Further details related to these amounts are set out \n in note 2. Additionally, to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the Group’s \n financial performance, the Group Consolidated Income Statement by nature of cost, \n through operating profit, is set out in note 4. \n \n Basis of consolidation\n The Group consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidation of the results,  \n the assets and the liabilities of the parent undertaking, and all of its subsidiaries, together \n with the Group’s share of the profits / losses of associates and joint ventures. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 74\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Subsidiary undertakings\n Subsidiary undertakings are those entities over which the Group has the power to control \n the operating and financial policies, so as to obtain economic benefit from their activities. \n The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or \n convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity. \n Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the \n group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Where necessary, the \n accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the \n policies adopted by the Group.\n \n Associates and joint ventures \n Associates are those entities over which the Group has a significant influence, but  \n not control, of the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over \n whose operating and financial policies the Group exercises control jointly, under a \n contractual agreement, with one or more parties. Investments in associates and joint \n ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n \n Under the equity method of accounting, the Group’s interest in the net assets of associates \n and joint ventures is included as investments in associates and joint ventures in the \n Group Consolidated Balance Sheet at an amount representing the Group’s share of the \n fair value of the identifiable net assets at acquisition, plus the Group’s share of post-\n acquisition retained income and expenses, less dividends received. The Group’s  \n investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill on acquisition. The Group  \n Consolidated Income Statement reflects, in profit before tax, the Group’s share of profit \n after tax of its associates and joint ventures and its share of post acquisition movements  \n in other comprehensive income are recognised in other comprehensive income, with a \n corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment, in accordance  \n with IAS 28, Investments in Associates, and IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures. When the \n group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, \n including any other unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, \n unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of  \n the associate.\n \n The amounts included in these Group consolidated financial statements in respect of  \n the post-acquisition profits or losses of associates and joint ventures are taken from their \n latest financial statements prepared up to their respective year ends, together with  \n management accounts for the intervening periods to the Group’s year end. The Group \n determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the \n investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the \n amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate \n and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the Group Consolidated Income \n Statement.\n \n Where an associate or joint venture is acquired or disposed of during the financial period, \n the Group consolidated financial statements include the attributable results from, or  \n up until, the effective date when significant influence or joint control is obtained, or lost.  \n If the ownership interest in an associate or joint venture is reduced, but significant  \n influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in \n other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss. Dilution gains and losses  \n arising in investments in associates are recognised in the Group Consolidated Income \n Statement.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 75\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses \n arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the Group consolidated \n financial statements. Unrealised gains and income and expenses arising from transactions \n with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in \n the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only \n to the extent that they do not provide evidence of impairment.\n \n Revenue recognition\n Revenue represents the fair value of the sale of goods supplied to third parties, after \n deducting trade discounts and volume rebates, and is exclusive of value-added tax. \n Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods \n have passed to the buyer, when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to  \n the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Income from services \n supplied is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion at the balance sheet  \n date. Financing income is recognised on an accruals basis, taking into consideration the \n sums lent and the actual interest rate applied.\n \n Segmental reporting\n Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports regularly \n reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (Chief Executive Officer) in \n making strategic decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance.\n \n As reflected in those reports, the Group is primarily organised into four operating \n segments: Food Europe, Food North America, Food Rest of World, (together referred to \n as the ‘Food Group’) and Origin, which includes the Group’s separately listed 68.8% \n subsidiary Origin Enterprises plc (‘Origin’). The Group’s principal geographical segments \n are Europe, North America and Rest of World.\n \n Food Europe has leading market positions in the speciality bakery market in Switzerland, \n Germany, the UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Sweden and Poland. In Europe, ARYZTA has  \n a mixture of business-to-business and consumer brands, including: Hiestand, Fresh Start \n Bakeries, Cuisine de France, Delice de France, Coup de Pates and Honeytop. Food \n Europe has a diversified customer base within the foodservice and retail channels. \n \n Food North America has leading positions in the speciality bakery market in the United \n States and Canada. It has a mixture of business-to-business and consumer brands, \n including: Fresh Start Bakeries, Otis Spunkmeyer, Great Kitchens, Maidstone Bakeries \n and La Brea Bakery. Food North America has a diversified customer base within the \n foodservice and retail channels.\n \n Food Rest of World consists of businesses in South America, Asia, Australia and  \n New Zealand.\n \n Origin is a leading agri-services group focused on integrated agronomy and agri-inputs in \n the UK, Ireland and Poland.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 76\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Segment assets and liabilities consist of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and \n intangible assets and other assets and liabilities that can be reasonably allocated to the \n reported segment. Unallocated assets and liabilities principally include current and \n deferred income tax assets and liabilities, together with financial assets and liabilities.\n \n Net finance costs and income tax are managed on a centralised basis and therefore \n these items are not allocated between operating segments for the purpose of presenting \n information to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.\n \n Research and development\n Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific \n or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an \n expense as incurred.\n \n Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan  \n or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes,  \n is capitalised, if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, the \n attributable expenditure can be reliably measured, and the Group has sufficient resources \n to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, \n direct labour or an appropriate proportion of overheads. Capitalised development \n expenditure is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Other \n development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as \n incurred.\n \n Employee benefits \n Pension obligations \n Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an \n expense in the income statement as the related employee service is received. The \n Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated, separately \n for each plan, by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned  \n in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The future benefit is discounted \n to determine the present value of the obligation and the fair value of any plan assets is \n deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate \n bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. The \n calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method on \n an annual basis. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the Group consolidated \n Statement of Comprehensive Income, net of related taxes. Current and past service costs \n are recognised as employment costs in the income statement. Interest on plan liabilities \n and expected return on assets are recognised in financing costs / income in the income \n statement. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 77\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Share-based compensation \n As defined in IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, the cost of equity instruments granted is \n recognised at fair value, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is \n measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees \n become unconditionally entitled to the equity instrument. The fair value of the equity \n instruments granted is measured using an approved model, taking into account the terms \n and conditions under which the equity instruments were granted. The Group’s equity-\n settled share-based compensation plans are subject to a non-market vesting condition; \n therefore, the amount recognised is adjusted annually to reflect the current estimate of \n achieving these conditions and the number of equity instruments expected to eventually \n vest. \n \n Termination benefits\n The Group recognises termination benefits when it has a formal plan to terminate the \n employment of current employees, which has been approved at the appropriate levels  \n of the organisation and when the entity is demonstrably committed to a termination \n through announcement of the plan to those affected. In the case of an offer made to \n encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on  \n the number of employees expected to accept the offer.\n \n Income Taxation\n Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income \n tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items \n recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case the related \n tax is also recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, respectively. \n Current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using \n tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet \n date, in the respective countries where the Group and its subsidiaries operate and generate \n taxable income.\n \n Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary \n differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting \n purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred income \n tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying \n amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the \n balance sheet date. If the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset  \n or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the \n transaction does not affect accounting or taxable profit or loss, it is not recognised. \n Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in \n subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the \n temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary \n difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 78\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n A deferred income tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future \n taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be recovered. Deferred \n income tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related \n tax benefit will be realised. \n \n Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable \n right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred \n income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority \n on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention  \n to settle the balances on a net basis.\n \n Foreign currency \n Items included in the financial statements of the Group’s entities are measured using  \n the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates  \n (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, \n the Group’s presentation currency, rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise \n stated.\n \n Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of each respective entity \n are translated to the relevant functional currency using the foreign exchange rate at the \n date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies \n are translated to the functional currency using the foreign exchange rate at the balance \n sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income  \n statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow \n hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n \n The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments \n arising on consolidation, are translated to euro at the foreign exchange rates at the \n balance sheet date. Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euro \n at the average exchange rates for the year, unless this average is not a reasonable \n approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, \n in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the \n transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the net assets of a \n foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income, as a change in the \n foreign currency translation reserve.\n \n Exchange gains or losses on long-term intra-group loans and on foreign currency borrowings \n used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in non-euro \n denominated operations, are included in other comprehensive income, as a change in \n the foreign currency translation reserve to the extent that they are neither planned  \n nor expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future, or are expected to provide an effective \n hedge of the net investment. Any differences that have arisen since 1 August 2004,  \n the date of transition to IFRS, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve \n and are recycled through the Group Consolidated Income Statement on the repayment  \n of the intra-group loan, or on disposal of the related business.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 79\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n The principal euro foreign exchange currency rates used by the Group for the preparation \n of these consolidated financial statements are as follows:\n \n Currency\n CHF\n USD\n CAD\n GBP\n \n Average 2012\n 1.2026\n 1.3240\n 1.3345\n 0.8379\n \n Closing 2012\n 1.2010\n 1.2370\n 1.2393\n 0.7854\n \n Average 2011\n 1.2862\n 1.3762\n 1.3676\n 0.8610\n \n  \n Closing 2011\n 1.1464\n 1.4323\n 1.3620\n 0.8761\n \n Dividends\n Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s \n shareholders.\n \n Property, plant and equipment \n Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and \n impairment losses. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases \n the future economic benefits embodied in the item of property, plant and equipment.  \n All other expenditures, including repairs and maintenance costs, are recognised in the \n income statement as an expense as incurred. \n \n Interest on specific and general borrowings used to finance construction costs of property, \n plant and equipment is capitalized during the period of time that is required to complete \n and prepare the asset for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are expensed.\n \n Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of property, \n plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, on a \n straight-line basis, by reference to the following estimated useful lives:\n \n Buildings  \n Plant and machinery \n Motor vehicles \n \n 25  to 50  years\n 3  to 15  years\n 3  to 7.5  years\n \n The residual value of assets, if significant, and the useful life of assets is reassessed \n annually. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable \n amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.\n \n Gains and losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment are recognised on  \n the completion of sale. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the \n proceeds received with the carrying amount and are included in operating profit.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 80\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Investment properties\n Investment property, principally comprised of land and buildings, is held for capital  \n appreciation. Investment property is stated at fair value. The fair value is based on market \n value, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged in an arm’s \n length transaction. Any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value is recognised  \n in the income statement. When property is transferred to investment property following a \n change in use, any difference arising at the date of transfer between the carrying amount \n of the property immediately prior to transfer and its fair value is recognised in equity if it is \n a gain. Upon disposal of the property, the gain would be transferred to retained earnings. \n Any loss arising in this manner, unless it represents the reversal of a previously recognised \n gain, would be recognised immediately in the income statement.\n \n Leased assets\n Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group has substantially all the risks \n and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised \n at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the \n present value of the minimum lease payments. Assets acquired under finance leases are \n depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.\n \n The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in interest-\n bearing loans and borrowings. The interest element of the payments is charged to the \n  income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of \n  interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. For disclosure  purposes, \n the fair value of finance leases is based on the present value of future cash flows, \n  discounted at appropriate current market rates. \n \n Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained  \n by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases \n are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n \n Business combinations and goodwill\n Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. The cost  \n of each acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration \n transferred, as at the acquisition date, and the amount of any non-controlling interest  \n in the acquiree. Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s \n previously held interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date \n and included within the consideration, with any gain or loss recognised in the Group \n Consolidated Income Statement. \n \n Where any part of the consideration for a business combination is deferred, the fair \n value of the deferred component is determined by discounting the estimated amounts \n payable to their present value at the acquisition date. The discount component is \n unwound as a finance charge in the Group Consolidated Income Statement over the life \n of the obligation. Subsequent changes to the estimated amounts payable for deferred \n consideration recognised on acquisitions occurring before 31 July 2009 are recognised \n directly as a change in goodwill. As a result of the implementation of IFRS 3 (Revised), \n Business Combinations, subsequent changes to the estimated amounts payable for \n deferred consideration recognised on acquisitions occurring after 1 August 2009 are \n recognised as a gain or loss in the Group Consolidated Income Statement.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 81\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Goodwill is initially recognised at cost, being the difference between cost of the acquisition \n over the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Following initial \n recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n \n When the initial accounting for a business combination is only provisionally determined  \n at the end of the financial year in which the combination occurs, any adjustments to the \n provisional values allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities are made within a \n period of no more than one year from the acquisition date. \n \n Acquisition costs arising in connection with a business combination are expensed as \n incurred.\n \n Intangible assets\n Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are initially recognised at fair value \n being their deemed cost as at the date of acquisition. These generally include brand and \n customer-related intangible assets. Computer software that is not an integral part of an item \n of computer hardware is also classified as an intangible asset. Where intangible assets are \n separately acquired, they are capitalised at cost. Cost comprises purchase price and other \n applicable directly attributable costs. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over  \n the period of their expected useful lives in equal annual instalments, generally as follows;\n \n Customer relationship\n Brands\n Patent and other\n Computer-related intangibles\n SAP-related intangibles\n \n 5 to 25 years\n 10 to 25 years\n 4 to 15 years\n 3 to 5 years\n 7 years\n \n Subsequent to initial recognition, the expected useful lives and related amortisation of finite \n lived intangible assets are reviewed at least at each financial year-end and if the expected \n economic benefits of the asset are different from previous estimates, amortisation is adjusted \n accordingly. Intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortisation and any \n impairment losses incurred. There are no intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.\n \n Impairment of non-financial assets\n The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories (which are carried at the \n lower of cost and net realisable value), deferred tax assets (which are recognised based on \n recoverability), and those financial instruments which are carried at fair value, are reviewed \n to determine whether there is an indication of impairment when an event or transaction \n indicates that there may be, and at least at each reporting date. If any such indication exists,  \n an impairment test is carried out and, if necessary, the asset is written down to its recoverable \n amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and \n an asset’s value in use. The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for \n use for impairment annually, during the last quarter of the financial year, or more frequently if \n events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 82\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset, or its cash  \n generating unit, exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised \n in the income statement as an expense. Goodwill is allocated to the various cash-generating \n units for the purposes of impairment testing. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-\n generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated  \n to the cash-generating unit, and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the  \n unit on a pro-rata basis. An impairment loss for goodwill is not subsequently reversed. An \n impairment loss for other assets may be reversed if there has been a change in the estimates \n used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent \n that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been \n determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n \n Inventory\n Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, and net realisable value. \n Cost includes all expenditure which has been incurred in the normal course of business \n in bringing the products to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the \n estimated selling price of inventory on hand, less all further costs to completion and all \n costs expected to be incurred in marketing, distribution and selling.\n \n Cash and cash equivalents\n Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily  \n convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of  \n changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank \n and in hand and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form \n an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and \n cash equivalents for the purpose of the Group Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.\n \n Share capital\n Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new \n shares are shown in equity, net of tax, as a deduction from the proceeds.\n \n If any Group company purchases ARYZTA AG’s equity share capital, those shares are \n accounted for as treasury shares in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. \n Consideration paid for treasury shares, including any directly attributable incremental \n cost, net of tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company, \n until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, \n any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs \n and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s \n shareholders.\n \n Financial assets and liabilities \n Trade and other receivables\n Trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments) are initially measured at fair value \n and are thereafter measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less  \n any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is recognised in administration \n expenses when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all \n amounts due, according to the original terms of the receivables. If collection is expected \n in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as \n non-current assets.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 83\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Where risks associated with trade receivables are transferred out of the Group under \n receivables purchase arrangements, such receivables are derecognised from the balance \n sheet, except to the extent of the Group’s continued involvement or exposure.\n \n Short-term bank deposits\n Short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which do not \n meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents, are classified as loans and receivables \n within current assets and stated at amortised cost in the balance sheet.\n \n Trade and other payables\n Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently \n measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. Trade and other \n payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less; \n otherwise; they are presented as non-current liabilities.\n \n Derivatives \n Derivatives, including forward currency contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity \n futures contracts are used to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk, \n interest rate risk and commodity price risk. These derivatives are generally designated  \n as cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition  \n and Measurement. The Group does not enter into speculative derivative transactions.\n \n Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the date the contract \n is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to fair value, as of each reporting date, \n using quoted market values. The gain or loss arising on re-measurement is recognised in \n the income statement, except where the instrument is a designated hedging instrument.\n \n Cash flow hedges\n Subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria relating to the documentation of the risk, \n objectives and strategy for the hedging transaction and the ongoing measurement of its \n effectiveness, cash flow hedges are accounted for under hedge accounting rules. In  \n such cases, any unrealised gain or loss arising on the effective portion of the derivative \n instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, as part of the cash flow  \n hedge reserve. Unrealised gains or losses on any ineffective portion are recognised in  \n the income statement. When the hedged transaction occurs the related gains or losses  \n in the cash flow hedge reserve are transferred to the income statement. \n \n Interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of attributable  \n transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated \n at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.\n \n Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are capitalised as transaction costs of  \n the loan, to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, \n and are amortised over the period of the facility to which the fees relate.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 84\n \n Group Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n For interest-bearing loans and borrowings with a contractual re-pricing date of less  \n than six months, the nominal amount is considered to approximate fair value for disclosure \n purposes. For loans with a re-pricing date of greater than six months, the fair value is \n calculated based on the expected future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at \n appropriate current market interest rates. \n \n Government grants\n Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are shown as deferred income \n and recognised in the income statement in instalments on a basis consistent with the \n depreciation policy of the relevant assets. Other grants are credited to the income statement \n to offset the matching expenditure.\n \n Provisions\n A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or \n constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of \n economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the outflow can be reliably \n measured. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected \n future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time \n value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n \n Transactions with non-controlling interests\n The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity \n owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference \n between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of \n net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-\n controlling interests are also recorded in equity.\n \n When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest  \n in the entity is re-measured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount \n recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes \n of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or \n financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive \n income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed  \n of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in \n other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. \n \n Reclassifications and adjustments\n Certain amounts in the 31 July 2011 Group consolidated financial statement notes  \n have been reclassified or adjusted to conform to the 31 July 2012 presentation.  \n These reclassifications or adjustments were made for presentation purposes and have  \n no effect on total revenues,  expenses, profit for the year, total assets, total liabilities, \n equity or cash flow classifications as previously reported.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 85\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Segment information\n \n 1 \n 1.1   Analysis by business segment\n \n I) Segment revenue and       \n result\n in EUR `000\n Segment revenue1\n \n Food \n Europe\n \n 2012\n \n 2011\n \n Food \n \n North America\n 2012\n 2011\n \n  1,273,707  1,184,928  1,372,411  1,212,463 \n \n Food \n \n Rest of World\n \n Total  \n \n Food Group\n \n Origin\n \n Total Group\n \n 2012\n  221,526 \n \n 2011\n \n 2012\n \n 2011\n \n 2012\n \n 2011\n \n 2012\n \n 2011\n \n  180,029  2,867,644  2,577,420  1,340,023  1,299,503  4,207,667  3,876,923 \n \n Operating profit before \n \n net acquisition, disposal \n and restructuring related \n costs and fair value \n adjustments 2\n \n Net acquisition, disposal \n \n and restructuring related \n costs and fair value \n adjustments (note 2)\n \n Operating profit\n Share of profit after tax \n of associates and joint \n ventures\n \n Profit before financing \n \n income, financing cost \n and income tax expense\n \n Financing income3\n Financing costs3\n Profit before income tax \n \n expense as reported \n in Group Consolidated \n Income Statement\n \n  124,750 \n \n  112,665 \n \n  128,597 \n \n  108,155 \n \n  21,696 \n \n  14,960 \n \n  275,043 \n \n  235,780 \n \n  62,823 \n \n  66,719 \n \n  337,866 \n \n  302,499 \n \n  (40,700) \n \n  (62,127) \n \n  (44,044) \n \n  64,105 \n \n  1,267 \n \n  (1,004) \n \n  (83,477) \n \n  974 \n \n  (16,152) \n \n  (11,010) \n \n  (99,629) \n \n  (10,036) \n \n  84,050 \n \n  50,538 \n \n  84,553 \n \n  172,260 \n \n  22,963 \n \n  13,956 \n \n  191,566 \n \n  236,754 \n \n  46,671 \n \n  55,709 \n \n  238,237 \n \n  292,463 \n \n  39 \n \n  7 \n \n  430 \n \n  3,706 \n \n  593 \n \n  909 \n \n  1,062 \n \n  4,622 \n \n  13,138 \n \n  14,857 \n \n  14,200 \n \n  19,479 \n \n  84,089 \n \n  50,545 \n \n  84,983 \n \n  175,966 \n \n  23,556 \n \n  14,865 \n \n  192,628 \n  7,276 \n  (65,993) \n \n  241,376 \n \n  5,959 \n \n  (63,365) \n \n  59,809 \n  7,285 \n  (13,879) \n \n  70,566 \n \n  6,106 \n \n  (16,616) \n \n  252,437 \n  14,561 \n  (79,872) \n \n  311,942 \n \n  12,065 \n \n  (79,981) \n \n  133,911 \n \n  183,970 \n \n  53,215 \n \n  60,056 \n \n  187,126 \n \n  244,026 \n \n 1 \n \n 2 \n \n 3 \n \n  There were no significant intercompany revenues between the Group’s food business segments.

The consideration was based  \n on a discounted cash flow enterprise value and was in line with market valuation multiples \n on comparable industry transactions. Maidstone is no longer treated as a joint venture  \n for accounting purposes and is now fully consolidated in the Food North America segment.  \n A non-cash gain of €121,391,000 on the previously owned 50% of Maidstone was  \n recorded within operating profit for the year ended 31 July 2011. This is a requirement \n under IFRS 3 (Revised), Business Combinations, which was implemented by the Group \n as required for the financial years ended after 1 August 2009. See note 29 for further \n details.\n \n 2.3 \n \n  Loss on disposal of Origin Food business  \n (financial year 2011)\n \n On 10 September 2010, the Group’s subsidiary and separately listed subsidiary, Origin, \n announced that it had reached an agreement with CapVest Limited to establish Valeo \n Foods Group Limited (‘Valeo’), to facilitate consolidation of Irish consumer food brands. \n On 26 November 2010, Origin further announced that Valeo had completed the  \n simultaneous acquisitions of the branded food businesses of Origin and the Irish food  \n company Batchelors. With effect from 26 November 2010, Origin’s investment in  \n Valeo has been treated as an associate undertaking and accounted for using the equity \n method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates. \n \n A loss of €7,301,000 was realised on the disposal of Origin Foods to Valeo during the \n year ended 31 July 2011. The impact of this loss on ARYZTA’s profit attributable to equity \n shareholders during the year ended 31 July 2011 was €5,214,000, which is after  \n deduction of Origin non-controlling interests.

The all-Ireland business was formed through the integration of \n Origin’s R&H Hall (‘Hall’) business in the Republic of Ireland with the business of Origin \n and Barnett in Northern Ireland. The transaction was completed on 28 January 2011. \n Under the terms of the transaction, Barnett acquired a 50% interest in Hall, mirroring the \n economic interests of Origin and Barnett in the Northern Ireland business. \n \n Origin now holds a 50% interest in Hall and, from 28 January 2011, this 50% holding  \n is treated as a joint venture in accordance with IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures. A gain \n arose on the transaction, which was recorded in the Group Consolidated Income  \n Statement for the year ended 31 July 2011, as follows:\n \n in EUR `000\n Net assets transferred on 28 January 2011:\n Property, plant and equipment\n Working capital\n Provisions for liabilities and charges\n Net assets transferred\n \n Consideration:\n Net cash consideration\n Fair value of 50% equity interest in Hall\n Total consideration received\n \n Gain on disposal of Origin Feed business\n \n 2011\n \n (15,412)\n (35,704)\n 2,667\n (48,449)\n \n 40,562\n 11,055\n 51,617\n \n 3,168\n \n  Gain/(loss) on dilution of associate interests\n \n 2.5 \n During the year, Origin's investment in Valeo was reduced from 44.1% to 32.0% as a \n result of Valeo raising additional funding from investors. As a result of this transaction, the \n Group recorded a gain of €2,305,000 on the dilution of the holding, which is recorded  \n in the Group Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 July 2012.\n \n In financial year 2011, Continental Farmers Group plc raised €16,726,000 of funding \n upon its flotation on the ESM and AIM markets of the Dublin and London stock  \n exchanges. As a result, Origin’s shareholding reduced from 38.7% to 24.2%. This gave \n rise to a loss of €4,738,000 on the dilution of the holding, which was recorded in  \n the Group Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 July 2011.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 91\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Transaction-related costs \n \n 2.6 \n Transaction-related costs of €3,255,000 incurred during the year ended 31 July 2012 \n relate primarily to Origin's share of Valeo transaction and rationalisation costs, as well  \n as costs associated with the Food Group acquisitions during the year. Transaction-related \n costs of €12,825,000 incurred during the year ended 31 July 2011 related primarily to \n the acquisition of the outstanding 50% of Maidstone. These costs include share purchase \n tax, due diligence and other professional service fees. Since the adoption of IFRS 3 \n (Revised), Business Combinations, these costs no longer form part of the acquisition \n consideration and are expensed within operating profit through the income statement. \n Details relating to these acquisitions are set out in note 29.\n \n 2.7  Restructuring-related costs and fair value adjustments\n During the year ended 31 July 2011, the Group commenced two separate integration  \n and rationalisation programmes in each of its Food Europe and Food North America  \n segments. These programmes allow the development of two principal operating platforms \n in Food Europe and Food North America to optimise the Group’s manufacturing and \n business support platforms.\n \n As a result of decisions made through these projects, the Group has recognised costs, \n including providing for amounts as required by IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities \n and Contingent Assets in the Group Consolidated Income Statement as follows:\n \n Asset write-downs and fair value adjustments \n The Group incurred €10,556,000 (2011: €43,039,000) of asset write-downs during  \n the year. These amounts relate primarily to the write-down of certain manufacturing,  \n distribution and administration assets, due to the closure and/or reduction in activity at \n a number of sites as part of the implementation of the Group's integration and  \n rationalisation programmes. \n \n Additionally, during the year a fair value adjustment of €9,665,000 (2011: Nil) was  \n recorded to the carrying value of investment properties within Origin. This was the result \n of the continuing decline in the Irish property market, a lack of transactions, restricted \n bank financing for property-related deals, a generally difficult economic environment, and  \n in particular the indication that the value of development land in regional areas is \n converging to that of agricultural land. Therefore, Origin's directors determined that an \n adjustment to the fair value of Origin's investment properties was necessary.\n \n Severance and other staff-related costs\n The Group has incurred and provided for €55,174,000 (2011: €46,963,000) in severance \n and other staff-related costs during the year, a majority of which relates to employees \n whose services were  discontinued following the actual or announced closure and  \n rationalisation of certain Group operational sites. \n \n Grant-related costs\n The termination of certain activities caused by the Group’s integration and rationalisation \n programmes have resulted in the triggering of related grant repayment conditions. This \n resulted in the reversal of €713,000 (2011: €2,338,000) in grants previously amortised \n through the Group's Consolidated Income Statement.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 92\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Contractual obligations\n The operational decisions made through the Group's integration and rationalisation  \n programmes triggered early termination and/or resulted in certain operational contracts \n becoming onerous. The Group incurred total costs of €3,012,000 (2011: €3,969,000) \n during the year to either exit or provide for such contracts.\n \n Advisory costs and other costs\n During the year, the Group incurred €20,976,000 (2011: €13,422,000) in other costs  \n related directly to the implementation of its integration and rationalisation programmes. \n These costs are composed principally of

IFRS 2, Share-based Payment. The Group has no \n legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the Matching Plan awards in cash.\n \n Participants with Matching Plan awards have the prospect of receiving up to three shares \n for each recognised qualifying interest held throughout the performance period. Vesting  \n is determined by reference to compound annual underlying fully diluted EPS growth. For \n awards outstanding as of 31 July 2012, vesting may occur on a fractional pro-rata basis \n ranging from a multiple of one to three for growth between 10.0% and 15.0%. In the \n event of the minimum 10.0% growth target not being achieved, no awards vest.\n \n Awards under the Matching Plan are subject to additional conditions, including notably: \n (a) the requirement to remain in service throughout the performance period; (b) the \n requirement to hold recognised qualifying interests throughout the performance period; \n (c) the requirement that the ARYZTA Food Group’s reported ROIC over the expected \n performance period is not less than its weighted average cost of capital and (d) the \n requirement that annual dividends to shareholders are at least 15% of the underlying EPS \n during the performance period.\n \n The Matching Plan awards can be exercised as of the time the performance conditions \n described above have been met, but no longer than ten years after grant date.\n \n The fair value assigned to equity entitlements issued under the Matching Plan represents \n the full value of an ordinary share on the date of grant adjusted for the estimated lost \n dividends between date of issue and vesting date and the nominal value of the share. The \n weighted average fair value of Matching Plan entitlements granted during the year was \n CHF 38.54.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 97\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n 8.2 \n \n ARYZTA Option Equivalent Plan LTIP\n \n Option Equivalent Plan awards\n Outstanding at the beginning of the year\n Issued during the year\n Forfeited during the year\n Outstanding at the end of the year\n Vested at the end of the year\n \n  \n Weighted \n conversion \n price 2012 \n in CHF\n  37.23 \n  39.95 \n  39.27 \n  38.72 \n  – \n \n Number of \n equity \n entitlements\n  1,200,000 \n  1,569,250 \n  (259,250) \n  2,510,000 \n  – \n \n  \n Weighted \n conversion \n price 2011 \n in CHF\n  37.23 \n – \n  –\n  37.23 \n  – \n \n Number of \n equity \n entitlements\n  1,200,000 \n –\n – \n  1,200,000 \n  – \n \n Option Equivalent Plan awards outstanding by \n conversion price\n Issued during financial year 2010\n Issued during financial year 2012\n As of 31 July 2012\n \n Conversion \n price \n in CHF\n 37.23\n 39.95\n 38.72\n \n Number of \n equity \n entitlements\n 1,135,000\n 1,375,000\n 2,510,000\n \n Actual \n remaining life \n (years)\n 7.1\n 9.2\n 8.3\n \n Plan description\n The equity instruments granted under the ARYZTA Option Equivalent Plan LTIP are \n equity-settled share-based payments as defined in IFRS 2, Share-based Payment.  \n The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the Option \n Equivalent awards in cash.\n \n Vesting of the awards under the Option Equivalent Plan is conditional on compound \n annual growth in underlying fully diluted EPS in three consecutive accounting periods \n exceeding the compound growth in the eurozone Core Consumer Price Index, plus 5%,  \n on an annualised basis. \n \n Awards under the Option Equivalent Plan are subject to additional conditions, including \n notably: (a) the requirement to remain in service throughout the performance period;  \n (b) the requirement that the ARYZTA Food Group's reported ROIC over the expected \n performance period is not less than its weighted average cost of capital and (c) the  \n requirement that annual dividends to shareholders are at least 15% of the underlying \n EPS during the performance period. \n \n The Option Equivalent Plan awards can be exercised as of the time the performance \n conditions described above have been met, but no longer than ten years after grant date.\n \n The weighted average fair value assigned to share option equivalents granted under the \n ARYZTA Option Equivalent Plan LTIP during the year ended 31 July 2012 was CHF 7.95, \n which was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The significant inputs \n into the model were the price of the shares as at the grant date, an expected option life of  \n five years, expected share price volatility of 26.75 %, the exercise price of CHF 39.95, the \n expected dividend yield of 1.5 %, and the risk-free rate of 0.36%. The volatility, measured  \n at the standard deviation of continuously compounded share returns, is based on  \n statistical analysis of monthly share prices of a peer group over the period of five years.  \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 98\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n The Group’s compound annual growth in underlying fully diluted EPS over the last three \n consecutive accounting periods was 12.9%, which exceeded the growth in the eurozone \n Core Consumer Price Index over the same period of 1.3%, plus 5%. Accordingly,  \n the performance conditions associated with the Option Plan awards outstanding as of \n 1 August 2011 were met during FY 2012. As a result, 1,135,000 Option Plan awards \n (650,000 of which are held by Executive Management) are eligible for vesting, pending \n Nomination and Remuneration Committee approval. The exercise price of all Option Plan \n awards for which the vesting conditions have been met is CHF 37.23.\n \n The Origin Enterprises Long-Term Incentive Plan\n \n 8.3 \n Participation in the Origin Plan is available only to employees of Origin and is specifically \n not available to ARYZTA executives, officers or employees.\n \n Origin Plan – ordinary share awards\n Under the terms of the Origin Plan, 4,682,134 ordinary shares were issued to senior \n executives of Origin during the year ended 31 July 2007. As the consideration paid for \n these shares equalled their fair value, no additional share-based compensation charge \n was recorded under IFRS 2, Share-based Payment. To retain the ordinary shares issued \n under the terms of the Origin Plan, the senior executives had to remain with Origin for \n five years and specified financial and business related targets had to be achieved. If the \n senior executive left before the end of the five year period or if the financial and business \n targets were not achieved, the ordinary shares issued under the terms of the Origin  \n Plan could have been reacquired by Origin at the lower of the amount paid for the shares \n and the then fair market value of the shares. The specified targets were achieved and \n accordingly the shares can no longer be reacquired.\n \n Origin Plan – awards of other equity entitlements\n Under the terms of the Origin Plan, senior executives of Origin were also issued equity  \n entitlements in Origin at par value, during 2007 and 2008. These equity entitlements \n convert on a one-to-one basis into ordinary shares in Origin after the expiration of five \n years, only if specified EPS growth targets are achieved and the employee remains in \n employment.\n \n During the five year period to 31 July 2011 the EPS growth targets were achieved. As a \n result, during April 2012 a total of 5,003,238 equity entitlements were converted on a \n one for one basis into ordinary shares. These shares are ranked pari passu in all respects \n with the existing ordinary shares of Origin. The remaining equity entitlements are  \n expected to convert into ordinary shares in FY 2013, after the related five year period for \n those equity entitlements is completed.\n \n The table below shows the movement in equity entitlements during the year:\n \n Origin Plan awards\n Outstanding at the beginning of the year\n Redeemed during the year \n Converted to ordinary shares during the year\n Outstanding at the end of the year\n Vested at the end of the year\n \n Weighted \n conversion \n price 2012 \n in EUR\n  0.01 \n –\n \n Number of \n equity \n entitlements \n 2012\n  5,483,583 \n –\n  0.01   (5,003,238) \n  0.01 \n  480,345 \n –\n –\n \n Weighted \n conversion \n price 2011 \n in EUR\n  0.01 \n  0.01 \n –\n  0.01 \n –\n \n Number of \n equity \n entitlements \n 2011\n  5,555,270 \n  (71,687) \n –\n  5,483,583 \n –\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 99\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n The equity entitlements issued under the Origin plan are equity-settled share-based \n payments as defined in IFRS 2, Share-based Payment.

Impairment testing on goodwill \n Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the  \n cash-generating units, or groups of cash generating-units, that are expected to benefit \n from the synergies of the business combination. Historically, this allocation was \n performed at the acquired business unit level, as this represented the lowest level within \n the entity at which goodwill was monitored for internal management purposes. This \n was the case as significant integration of the individually acquired businesses had not \n occurred and the business units were managed autonomously. Due to the significant \n reorganisation of historical acquired business units as part of the ARYZTA Transformation \n Initiative, effective during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, management began formally \n evaluating business performance and allocating resources at the operating segment  \n level and no longer at the former business unit level. As such, this will become the lowest \n level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.  \n In line with this change, allocation of any goodwill from future acquisitions, as well as future \n annual impairment testing, will be performed at the operating segment level.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 107\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the historical individual cash-generating \n units, as well as the relevant operating segments, are summarised as follows:\n \n in EUR ’000\n Hiestand Europe\n Groupe Hubert\n Fresh Start Bakeries \n \n Europe\n \n Other1\n Total Food Europe\n \n Otis Spunkmeyer\n La Brea Bakery\n Great Kitchens\n Fresh Start Bakeries North \n \n America\n \n Maidstone Bakeries\n Total Food North America\n \n Fresh Start Bakeries Rest \n \n of World\n \n Hiestand Rest of World1\n Total Food Rest of World\n \n Agrii\n Other1\n Total Origin\n \n Pre-tax \n discount \n rate \n 2012\n 6.2%\n 9.4%\n \n Pre-tax \n discount \n rate \n 2011\n 6.6%\n 9.0%\n \n Projection \n period\n  2 years \n  2 years \n \n Carrying \n value \n 2012\n \n Terminal \n Carrying \n growth  \n value \n rate\n 2011\n 2%  426,564  437,340\n 2%  105,812  105,812\n \n 7.4%\n –\n \n 8.2%\n –\n \n  2 years \n  – \n \n 6.7%\n 8.7%\n 8.7%\n \n 8.7%\n 7.1%\n \n 7.5%\n 9.4%\n 9.8%\n \n 9.8%\n 7.9%\n \n  2 years \n  2 years \n  2 years \n \n  2 years \n  2 years \n \n 2%  34,215 \n  156,674 \n  723,265 \n \n  – \n \n  34,078 \n  98,136 \n  675,366 \n \n 2%  445,989 \n 2%  59,114 \n 2%  83,149 \n \n  385,176 \n  50,916 \n  71,812 \n \n 2%  29,240 \n 2%  295,691 \n  913,183 \n \n  25,390 \n  268,816 \n  802,110 \n \n 7.8%\n –\n \n 8.9%\n –\n \n  2 years \n  – \n  \n \n 2%  65,010 \n  8,105 \n  73,115 \n \n  – \n  \n \n  53,480 \n  7,092 \n  60,572 \n \n 11.6%\n –\n \n 9.9%\n –\n \n  3 years \n  – \n \n  – \n \n 2%  68,186 \n  13,735 \n  81,921 \n \n  62,356 \n  12,653 \n  75,009 \n  1,791,484  1,613,057 \n \n Goodwill arising on investments  \n \n in JVs and associates\n \n  72,746 \n \n  49,336 \n \n 1 \n \n  Comprise of goodwill in a number of cash-generating units which are individually insignificant.\n \n The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, during the last quarter of the financial \n year, or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.  \n No impairment losses have been recognised related to the Group’s goodwill during the \n years ended 31 July 2012 and 31 July 2011.\n \n The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on value-in-use calculations. \n These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on expected future operating  \n results and related cash flows at the time the impairment test is performed. These  \n projections are based on current operating results of the individual cash-generating units \n and an assumption regarding future organic growth. For the purposes of the calculation \n of value-in-use, the cash flows are projected based on financial budgets approved by  \n management, with additional cash flows in subsequent years calculated using a terminal \n value methodology and discounted using the relevant rate, as disclosed in the table \n above.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 108\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Any significant adverse change in the expected future operational results and cash flows \n may result in the value-in-use being less than the carrying amount of a cash-generating \n unit and would require that the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit be impaired \n and stated at the recoverable amount of the business unit. However, based on the results \n of the impairment testing undertaken during the years ended 31 July 2012 and 31 July \n 2011, sufficient headroom exists such that any reasonable movement in any of the \n underlying assumptions would not give rise to an impairment charge. Key assumptions \n include management’s estimates of future profitability, specifically the terminal growth \n rate, as well as the discount rate used. \n \n The terminal growth rate within the discounted cash flow model is a significant factor \n in determining the value-in-use of the cash-generating units. A terminal growth rate is \n included to take into account the Group’s strong financial position, its established history \n of earnings growth, ongoing cash flow generation and its proven ability to pursue and \n integrate value-enhancing acquisitions. The terminal growth rates utilised approximated \n the relevant long-term inflation rates. While the terminal growth rate is a significant factor \n in the goodwill impairment testing, reducing the terminal growth rate to 0.0% would not \n give rise to a material impairment.\n \n The discount rate used is also a significant factor in determining the value-in-use of the \n cash-generating units. These rates are based on the relevant risk-free rate, adjusted to \n reflect the risk associated with the respective future cash flows from that cash-generating \n unit.

Financial Statements\n \n 117\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Estimation of fair values\n Set out below are the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values \n of the financial assets and liabilities disclosed in the preceding table.\n \n Trade and other receivables / payables\n All trade and other receivables or payables, other than the forward purchase obligation \n mentioned below, are carried at amortised cost, less any impairment provision. For  \n any trade and other receivables or payables with a remaining life of less than six months \n or demand balances, the carrying value, less impairment provision where appropriate,  \n is deemed to reflect fair value.\n \n Cash and cash equivalents, including short-term bank deposits\n For short-term bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents, all of which have an original \n and remaining maturity of less than three months, the nominal amount is deemed to \n reflect fair value.\n \n Derivatives (forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps)\n Forward currency contracts are marked to market using quoted forward exchange rates \n at the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the  \n present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.\n \n Interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n For interest-bearing loans and borrowings with a contractual re-pricing date of less than \n six months, the nominal amount is considered to approximate fair value for disclosure \n purposes. For loans with a re-pricing date of greater than six months, the fair value is \n calculated based on the expected future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at \n appropriate current market interest rates.\n \n Finance lease liabilities\n Fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at implicit interest \n rates.\n \n Forward purchase obligation \n The other long-term liability related to the HiCoPain forward purchase contract (notes 18 \n and 26) is carried at fair value through profit and loss. In accordance with the terms \n of that agreement, the fair value of this financial instrument is based on the estimated \n net book value of HiCoPain AG upon the final exit of the minority shareholder. As the fair \n value of this obligation is based on inputs not observable within the market, it has been \n classified as a Level 3 financial liability. No gains or losses related to changes in the fair \n value of this liability were recognised within the Group Consolidated Income Statement \n or Group Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income during the year and no \n reasonably possible changes in assumptions would result in a material change in the fair \n value of this financial obligation.    \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 118\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Fair value hierarchy\n The tables at the beginning of this note summarise the financial instruments carried at \n fair value, by valuation method. Fair value classification levels have been assigned to \n the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value. The different levels assigned are \n defined as follows:\n \n Level 1:  Prices quoted in active markets\n Level 2:  Valuation techniques based on observable market data\n Level 3:  Valuation techniques based on unobservable inputs\n \n Risk exposures\n Group risk management\n Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice at all levels \n and encompasses different types of risks. This overall Group risk management process \n includes the performance of a risk assessment that is described in more detail in note 33. \n Financial risk management specifically is described in further detail below.\n \n Financial risk management\n The Group’s international operations expose it to different financial risks that include:\n –  credit risks,\n liquidity risks,\n – \n foreign exchange rate risks,\n – \n – \n interest rate risks, and \n –  commodity price risks. \n \n The Group has a risk management programme in place, which seeks to limit the impact \n of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. The Board has determined  \n the policies for managing these risks. It is the policy of the Board to manage these risks \n in a non-speculative manner.\n  \n Credit risk\n Exposure to credit risk\n Credit risk arises from credit issued to customers on outstanding receivables and  \n outstanding transactions, as well as cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial  \n instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n \n Trade and other receivables\n The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics \n of each customer. There is no concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual \n customers or geographically.\n \n The Group has detailed procedures for monitoring and managing the credit risk related \n to its trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default \n rates. Individual risk limits are generally set by customer, and risk is only accepted above \n such limits in defined circumstances. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. \n Impairment provisions are used to record impairment losses, unless the Group is satisfied \n that no recovery of the amount owing is possible. At that point the amount is considered \n irrecoverable and is written off directly against the trade receivable.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 119\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred \n losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components \n of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant \n exposures and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in \n respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.\n \n The Group also manages credit risk through the use of a receivables purchase arrangement \n with a financial institution. Under the terms of this non-recourse agreement, the Group  \n has transferred credit risk and control of certain trade receivables, amounting to \n €28,114,000 (2011: €38,705,000). The Group has continued to recognise an asset \n of €352,000 (2011: €680,000), representing the maximum extent of its continuing \n involvement or exposure and an associated liability of a similar amount.\n \n Cash and short-term bank deposits\n Cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest short-\n term credit rating, with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions at \n any one time. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these \n counterparties. \n \n Exposure to credit risk\n The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions, represents the \n Group’s maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year-end was \n as follows:\n \n in EUR `000\n Trade and other receivables\n Cash and cash equivalents\n Derivative financial assets\n \n Carrying \n amount \n 2012\n  546,657 \n  547,474 \n  422 \n  1,094,553 \n \n Carrying  \n amount \n 2011\n  478,729 \n  482,229 \n  608 \n  961,566 \n \n The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by  \n geographic region was as follows:\n \n in EUR `000\n Europe\n North America\n Rest of World\n \n Carrying \n amount \n 2012\n  381,370 \n  86,440 \n  22,881 \n  490,691 \n \n Carrying  \n amount \n 2011\n  307,110 \n  94,249 \n  18,858 \n  420,217 \n \n  \n The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by type  \n of customer was as follows:\n \n in EUR `000\n Food Group trade receivables\n Origin trade receivables\n \n Carrying \n amount \n 2012\n  228,548 \n  262,143 \n  490,691 \n \n Carrying  \n amount \n 2011\n  212,333 \n  207,884 \n  420,217 \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 120\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n The aging of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows:\n \n in EUR `000\n Not past due\n Past due 0–30 days\n Past due 31–120 days\n Past due more than 121 days\n \n Gross \n 2012\n  369,987 \n  96,800 \n  32,660 \n  5,320 \n  504,767 \n \n Impairment \n 2012\n  114 \n  278 \n  8,364 \n  5,320 \n  14,076 \n \n Gross \n 2011\n  322,292 \n  79,762 \n  24,766 \n  6,651 \n  433,471 \n \n Impairment \n 2011\n  371 \n  222 \n  8,814 \n  3,847 \n  13,254 \n \n The Group standard payment terms are typically 0 – 60 days.

The Group’s policy is that not more than 40 % of total bank borrowing facilities \n should mature in any twelve-month period. At 31 July 2012, 16% of the Group’s total \n borrowings will mature within the next 12 months.\n \n In November 2011, the Food Group agreed an amendment to its existing syndicated loan \n facility, which increased the amount available from CHF 600,000,000 (€499,567,000) \n to CHF 970,000,000 (€807,633,000) and extended the maturity of the facility by two \n years to December 2016, with unchanged interest rate margins and financial covenants. \n The Food Group also has USD 1,070,000,000 (€864,996,000) and €25,000,000 \n private placement facilities and a CHF 200,000,000 (€166,522,000) Swiss-listed bond. \n Short-term flexibility is achieved through the availability of overdraft facilities totalling \n €339,683,000. \n \n In July 2011, Origin negotiated new syndicated loan facilities with an available principal  \n of €300,000,000, which matures in July 2016. In March 2012, Origin additionally  \n arranged an unsecured term loan facility with an available principal of €30,000,000, \n which matures in March 2015. Short-term flexibility is achieved through the availability  \n of overdraft facilities totalling €59,334,000. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 121\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n 2012\n in EUR `000\n Non-derivative financial  \n \n liabilities\n \n Fixed rate bank loans\n Variable rate bank loans\n Finance lease liabilities\n Bank overdrafts\n Trade and other payables\n Forward purchase obligation\n Derivative financial  \n \n instruments\n \n Interest rate swaps used for \n \n hedging\n \n Currency forward contracts \n \n used for hedging\n \n  – Inflows\n  – Outflows\n \n 2011\n in EUR `000\n Non-derivative financial  \n \n liabilities\n \n Fixed rate bank loans\n Variable rate bank loans\n Finance lease liabilities\n Bank overdrafts\n Trade and other payables\n Derivative financial  \n \n instruments\n \n Interest rate swaps used for \n \n hedging\n \n Currency forward contracts \n \n used for hedging\n \n  – Inflows\n  – Outflows\n \n The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated \n interest payments:\n \n Carrying \n amount\n \n Contractual \n cash flows\n \n 6 mths or less\n \n 6 – 12 mths\n \n 1 – 2 years\n \n 2 – 5 years\n \n More than \n 5 years\n \n  (1,052,416) \n  (333,072) \n  (3,692) \n  (202,385) \n  (929,133) \n  (13,446) \n \n  (1,422,451) \n  (380,358) \n  (3,863) \n  (202,385) \n  (929,133) \n  (13,446) \n \n  (24,161) \n  (5,002) \n  (1,389) \n  (202,385) \n  (900,398) \n –  \n \n  (86,162) \n  (5,002) \n  (1,161) \n  – \n  (17,601) \n –  \n \n  (173,167) \n  (10,002) \n  (969) \n  – \n  (2,962) \n – \n \n  (523,604) \n  (360,352) \n  (344) \n  – \n  (3,461) \n  (13,446) \n \n  (615,357) \n  – \n  – \n  – \n  (4,711) \n –  \n \n  (3,112) \n \n  (3,112) \n \n  (560) \n \n  (544) \n \n  (1,026) \n \n  (982) \n \n  – \n \n  – \n  (2,812) \n  (2,540,068) \n \n  77,325 \n  (80,137) \n  (2,957,560) \n \n  75,056 \n  (77,717) \n  (1,136,556) \n \n  2,269 \n  (2,420) \n (110,621)\n \n  – \n  – \n (188,126)\n \n  – \n  – \n (902,189)\n \n  – \n  – \n  (620,068) \n \n Carrying \n amount\n \n Contractual \n cash flows\n \n 6 mths or less\n \n 6 – 12 mths\n \n 1 – 2 years\n \n 2 – 5 years\n \n More than \n 5 years\n \n  (941,599) \n  (420,662) \n  (2,963) \n  (164,593) \n  (847,146) \n \n  (1,306,798) \n  (483,540) \n  (3,253) \n  (164,593) \n  (847,146) \n \n  (20,945) \n  (7,515) \n  (657) \n  (164,593) \n  (817,344) \n \n  (26,615) \n  (7,515) \n  (831) \n  – \n  (19,053) \n \n  (96,432) \n  (15,030) \n  (1,137) \n  – \n  (4,411) \n \n  (427,406) \n  (453,480) \n  (628) \n  – \n  (3,621) \n \n  (735,400) \n  – \n  – \n  – \n  (2,717) \n \n  (206) \n \n  (206) \n \n  (46) \n \n  (46) \n \n  (60) \n \n  (54) \n \n  – \n \n  – \n  (3,226) \n  (2,380,395) \n \n  98,879 \n  (102,105) \n  (2,808,762) \n \n  72,079 \n  (73,891) \n  (1,012,912) \n \n  21,770 \n  (22,999) \n  (55,289) \n \n  5,030 \n  (5,215) \n  (117,255) \n \n  – \n  – \n  (885,189) \n \n  – \n  – \n  (738,117) \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 122\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Accounting for derivatives and hedging activities \n The fair value of derivative financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date is set \n out in the following table: \n \n in EUR `000\n Cash flow hedges\n  Currency forward contracts\n  Interest rate swaps\n At 31 July\n \n Assets \n 2012\n \n Liabilities \n 2012\n \n Assets \n 2011\n \n Liabilities \n 2011\n \n  416 \n  6 \n  422 \n \n  (2,812) \n  (3,112) \n  (5,924) \n \n  608 \n  – \n  608 \n \n  (3,226) \n  (206) \n  (3,432) \n \n Cash flow hedges\n Cash flow hedges are those of highly probable forecasted future income or expenses. In \n order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document the relationship  \n between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument and demonstrate, at  \n inception, that the hedge relationship will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. The \n hedge relationship must be tested for effectiveness on subsequent reporting dates.\n \n There is no significant difference between the timing of the cash flows and the income \n statement effect of cash flow hedges.\n  \n Market risk\n Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices and indices, such as foreign  \n exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its  \n holdings of financial instruments.  \n \n Foreign exchange risk\n In addition to the Group’s operations carried out in eurozone economies, it also has \n significant operations in the UK, Switzerland and North America. As a result, the Group \n Consolidated Balance Sheet is exposed to currency fluctuations including, in particular, \n sterling, US dollar, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc movements. The Group manages \n its balance sheet having regard to the currency exposures arising from its assets being \n denominated in a wide range of currencies. \n \n Net investment hedges\n As part of its approach towards mitigating its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group \n will, when required, fund foreign currency assets in the currency of the related assets. \n \n These relationships are typically designated by the Group as net investment hedges of \n foreign currency exposures on net investments in foreign operations using the borrowings \n as the hedging instrument. These hedge designations allow the Group to mitigate the  \n risk of foreign currency exposures on the carrying amount of net assets in foreign  \n operations in its Group consolidated financial statements. \n \n The borrowings designated in net investment hedge relationships are measured at fair \n value, with the effective portion of the change in value of the borrowings being recognised \n directly through equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. Any ineffectiveness \n arising on such hedging relationships is recognised immediately in the income statement. \n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 123\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Currency swaps\n The Group also hedges a portion of its transactional currency exposure through the use  \n of currency swaps. Transactional exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating \n unit in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. The Group requires its \n operating units to use forward currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures on \n certain foreign currency purchases. The forward currency contracts must be in the same \n currency and match the settlement terms of the hedged item.\n \n The following table details the Group’s exposure to transactional foreign currency risk at \n 31 July 2012:\n \n USD\n  1,637 \n  80 \n  4,158 \n  (3,655) \n  (580) \n \n  (274) \n  1,366 \n \n CAD\n  5,174 \n  28 \n  4,531 \n  (2,743) \n  (2,601) \n \n  (207) \n  4,182 \n \n CHF\n  1,847 \n –  \n  37 \n  (837) \n  (1,821) \n \n  (59) \n  (833) \n \n EUR\n  4,334 \n –  \n  11,286 \n  (30,172) \n  (1,956) \n \n  (1,887) \n  (18,395) \n \n Other\n  2,227 \n  46 \n  773 \n  (180) \n –  \n \n  (147) \n  2,719 \n \n Total\n  19,947 \n  154 \n  21,716 \n  (41,778) \n  (8,182) \n \n  (4,744) \n  (12,887) \n \n The following table details the Group’s exposure to transactional foreign currency risk at \n 31 July 2011:\n \n USD\n  1,380 \n  55 \n  1,606 \n  (9,055) \n  (180) \n \n  (877) \n  (7,071) \n \n CAD\n  6,310 \n  56 \n  3,004 \n  (4,482) \n  (2,168) \n \n  – \n  2,720 \n \n CHF\n  1,764 \n  – \n  9 \n  (813) \n  (638) \n \n  42 \n  364 \n \n EUR\n  8,817 \n  215 \n  10,255 \n  (24,186) \n  (1,778) \n \n  (474) \n  (7,151) \n \n Other\n  1,972 \n  46 \n  251 \n  (56) \n  – \n \n  – \n  2,213 \n \n Total\n  23,577 \n  372 \n  19,609 \n  (42,663) \n  (5,119) \n \n  (1,220) \n  (5,444) \n \n GBP\n  4,728 \n  –   \n  931 \n  (4,191) \n  (1,224) \n \n  (2,170) \n  (1,926) \n \n GBP\n  3,334 \n  – \n  4,484 \n  (4,071) \n  (355) \n \n  89 \n  3,481 \n \n 2012\n in EUR `000\n Trade receivables\n Other receivables\n Cash and cash equivalents\n Trade payables\n Other payables\n Derivative financial  \n \n instruments\n \n At 31 July 2012\n \n 2011\n in EUR `000\n Trade receivables\n Other receivables\n Cash and cash equivalents\n Trade payables\n Other payables\n Derivative financial  \n \n instruments\n \n At 31 July 2011\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 124\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Currency sensitivity analysis \n A 10 % strengthening or weakening of the euro against the following currencies at  \n 31 July would have increased / (decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts \n shown below.

with the business unit’s expected purchase, sale or  \n usage requirements. ‘Own use’ contracts are outside the scope of IAS 39, Financial \n Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and are accounted for on an accruals basis. \n Where a commodity contract is not entered into, or does not continue to be held to \n meet the Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements, it is treated as

ARY LTIP Trustee \n is a wholly owned subsidiary of ARYZTA, formed for the purpose of holding shares subject \n to the ARYZTA LTIP. ARY LTIP Trustee holds all treasury shares, pending satisfaction  \n of the applicable terms of the ARYZTA LTIP.\n \n At the Annual General Meeting on 1 December 2011, the shareholders approved the \n resolution to abolish Article 4 of the Articles of Association, which previously established \n conditional share capital for Employee Benefit Plans. \n \n Furthermore, the shareholders also approved the resolution to modify Article 5 of the \n Articles of Association (governing Authorised Share Capital for General Purposes). \n Pursuant to these modifications, the Board of Directors was authorised to increase the \n share capital at any time until 30 November 2013 by an amount not exceeding  \n CHF 255,134.38 through the issue of up to 12,756,719 fully paid-up registered shares \n with a nominal value of CHF 0.02 each. The Board of Directors was authorised to  \n exclude the subscription rights of the shareholders and to allocate them to third parties  \n if the shares are used for the following purposes: \n \n (1)   acquisition of enterprises or parts thereof or participations therein, new investments \n or the financing of any of those transactions (maximum of 8,504,479 fully paid-up \n registered shares),\n \n (2)   broadening the shareholder constituency (maximum of 4,252,239 fully paid-up  \n \n registered shares), or \n \n (3)  for the purpose of the participation of employees (maximum of 2,551,343 fully paid-\n \n up registered shares). \n \n On 16 January 2012, the issued shares were increased to 91,810,534 by the issue of  \n 4,252,239 registered shares at CHF 41.00 per share. As part of the issuance of these shares,  \n the Board also approved the resolution to modify Article 5 of the Articles of Association  \n to remove item (2) above. Pursuant to these modifications, the Board of Directors is now  \n authorised to increase the share capital at any time until 30 November 2013 by an \n amount not exceeding CHF 170,089.58 through the issue of up to 8,504,480 fully paid-up  \n registered shares.\n \n These increases in share capital in November 2011 and January 2012 resulted in  \n proceeds of €140,854,000, net of associated share registration, stamp duty and issuance \n costs.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 133\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Treasury shares of CHF 0.02 each –  \n authorised, called up and fully paid\n At 1 August\n Creation and issue of shares to ARY LTIP \n \n Trustee\n \n Release of treasury shares upon vesting \n \n and exercise of matching shares\n \n At 31 July \n \n 2012\n `000 \n  2,234 \n \n  2,514 \n \n  (975) \n  3,773 \n \n 2012\n in EUR `000 \n  30 \n \n 2011\n `000 \n  2,234 \n \n 2011\n in EUR `000 \n  30 \n \n  41 \n \n  (14) \n  57 \n \n  – \n \n  – \n  2,234 \n \n  – \n \n  – \n  30 \n \n On 23 September 2011, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee approved the \n vesting of all equity entitlements outstanding under the ARYZTA Matching Plan LTIP, as \n all performance conditions associated with those awards were met as of 31 July 2011.  \n As the share subscription price associated with these equity entitlements was paid by \n plan participants to ARY LTIP Trustee at the inception of the plan, in accordance with  \n the terms of the plan, upon approval of vesting the associated shares were issued to plan \n participants out of shares previously held in treasury by ARY LTIP Trustee. The share \n price at the time of the exercise was CHF 39.05 per share.\n \n Other equity reserve\n In October 2010, the Group raised CHF 400,000,000 through the issuance of a Perpetual  \n Callable Subordinated Instrument (‘Hybrid Instrument’), which has been recognised  \n at a carrying value of €285,004,000 within equity, net of transaction costs of €7,436,000. \n The Hybrid Instrument offers a coupon of 5%, accruing €16,642,000 to 31 July 2012 \n (2011: €11,801,000), and has no maturity date, with an initial call date by ARYZTA after \n four years from issuance. In the event that the call option is not exercised after four \n years, the coupon would be 905 bp plus the 3-month CHF LIBOR. \n \n Cash flow hedge reserve\n The cash flow hedge reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change \n in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that \n have not yet occurred.\n \n Revaluation reserve\n The revaluation reserve as of 31 July 2012 relates to surpluses arising on revaluations  \n of land and buildings previously held as investment property. During the year €1,361,000  \n was transferred from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings in connection with \n ARYZTA equity shareholders’ portion of the fair value adjustments to investment properties \n held in Origin. During prior years the revaluation reserve also included €17,960,000 \n related to the revaluation of the Origin Food business, which was transferred from the \n revaluation reserve to retained earnings upon disposal of that associate interest in 2011.\n \n Share-based payment reserve\n This reserve comprises amounts credited to reserves in connection with equity awards, \n less the effect of any exercises of such awards.\n \n Foreign currency translation reserve\n The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences from 1 August 2004, \n the date of the Group’s transition to IFRS, arising from the translation of the net assets  \n of the Group’s non-euro-denominated operations, including the translation of the profits \n of such operations from the average exchange rate for the year to the exchange rate at \n the balance sheet date, net of hedging.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 134\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Transaction with non-controlling interest\n During March 2012, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 40% \n interest in HiCoPain AG. Based on this agreement, the minority shareholder continues \n to participate in the risk and rewards of the business until the final exit date, which is \n expected to occur between 2016 and 2020. At that time consideration based on the net \n book value of HiCoPain AG will be paid to the minority shareholder.\n \n A liability of CHF 16,149,000 (€13,429,000 as of the date of the agreement and \n €13,446,000 as of 31 July 2012) has been recorded representing the estimated future \n consideration to be paid, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of the \n Group. Upon final exit of the minority shareholder, the related carrying value of the non-\n controlling interest will be eliminated as a corresponding increase in retained earnings.\n \n Capital management\n The capital managed by the Group consists of the Group equity of €2,509,355,000  \n (2011: €2,196,506,000). The Group has set the following goals for the management of \n its capital:\n –  To maintain prudent net debt (as set out in note 21 of these Group consolidated \n \n financial statements) to EBITDA1 and interest cover (EBITDA1 to interest) ratios to \n support a prudent capital base and ensure a long-term sustainable business.\n \n –  To achieve a return for investors in excess of the Group’s weighted average cost of \n \n capital.\n \n –  To apply a dividend policy which takes into account the Group’s financial performance \n \n and position, the Group’s future outlook and other relevant factors including tax and \n other legal considerations.\n \n As set out in note 21 of these Group consolidated financial statements, the Group operates \n two distinct debt funding structures. \n –  The Food Group net debt amounted to €976,283,000 at 31 July 2012  \n \n (2011: €955,468,000) and relates to the ARYZTA Food segments of the group.\n –  The Group’s separately listed subsidiary, Origin Enterprises plc, has separate   \n \n funding structures, which are financed without recourse to ARYZTA AG. Origin net \n debt amounted to €67,808,000 at 31 July 2012 (2011: €92,120,000). \n \n The Food Group employs four ratio targets to monitor equity and its financing covenants:\n –  The Food Group’s net debt to EBITDA1 ratio is below 3.5 times – the ratio was 2.05 \n \n times at 31 July 2012 (2011: 2.24 times).\n \n –  The Food Group’s interest cover (EBITDA1 to interest) is above 4 times – the ratio was \n \n 8.10 times at 31 July 2012 (2011: 7.4 times).\n \n –  The Food Group’s minimum equity shall not be below €1,000,000,000 at any time \n \n –  the equity at 31 July 2012 was €2,317,810,000 (2011: €2,029,733,000).\n \n –  The Food Group’s minimum equity ratio (equity / consolidated assets) shall amount to \n \n at least 35 % at any time – the ratio was 49% at 31 July 2012 (2011: 47%).\n \n These ratios are reported to the Board of Directors at regular intervals through internal \n financial reporting.\n \n 1  Calculated based on the Food Group EBITDA for the year ended 31 July 2012 of €465.2m, which is then \n \n adjusted by the dividend received from Origin of €10.5m and for the pro forma full-year contribution of Food \n Group acquisitions.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 135\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n The proposed payout ratio to shareholders for the Group’s financial year to 31 July 2012 \n is 15% of fully diluted underlying earnings per share. The payout will be in the form of \n a dividend.

As a result of this dilution, the \n Group has recorded a reduction in the individual equity balances within the Group’s \n total shareholders’ equity and allocated these balances as an increase in non-controlling \n interests.\n \n Commitments\n \n 28 \n 28.1  Commitments under operating leases\n Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as set out below.

As a result and from that date, Maidstone has been  \n accounted for as a subsidiary undertaking and not as a joint venture. \n \n The goodwill arising on this business combination was attributable to the skills and talent \n of the Maidstone work force, the synergies expected to be achieved from integrating \n Maidstone into the Group’s existing businesses and increasing capacity utilisation of the \n facility.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 138\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Origin acquisitions\n During the prior year, Origin completed a number of acquisitions in the United Kingdom.\n \n On 8 March 2011, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of United Agri Products \n Limited, a premier provider of agronomy services to arable, fruit and vegetable growers.\n \n On 9 March 2011, the Group acquired 100% of Rigby Taylor Limited, a leading service \n provider supplying advice and technical product solutions to the professional sports turf, \n landscape and amenity sectors. \n \n On 13 July 2011, the Group acquired 100% of Origin Fertilisers 2011 Limited from Carrs \n Milling Industries plc.

The Group has formal risk assessment processes in place \n through which risks and mitigating controls are evaluated. These processes are driven  \n by local management of the business, who are best placed to identify the significant ongoing \n and emerging risks facing the business. The outputs of these risk assessment processes \n are subject to various levels of review by Group management and Internal Audit, and a  \n consolidated Risk Map denoting potential frequency, severity and velocity of identified \n risks, is reviewed by the ARYZTA Board of Directors on an annual basis. Risks identified \n and associated mitigating controls are also subject to audit, as part of operational, \n financial and health and safety audit programmes.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 141\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Accounting estimates and judgements\n \n 34 \n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management  \n to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting \n policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.\n \n Information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements  \n in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts  \n recognised in the Group consolidated financial statements are described below:\n \n Note\n Note 8\n Note 13\n Note 14\n Note 22\n Note 24\n Note 25\n \n Name\n Share-based payments\n Investment properties\n Goodwill and intangible assets\n Financial instruments and financial risk\n Deferred tax\n Employee benefits\n \n The Group has share-based incentive grants outstanding under various incentive plans. \n Estimating the value of these grants, and the period over which this value will be  \n recognised as an expense, requires various management estimates and assumptions, \n as set out in note 8. \n \n Investment property, principally comprised of land and buildings, is stated at fair value. \n The associated fair value is based on estimates of the market value of the underlying \n property, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged in arm’s \n length transaction, as set out in note 13.\n \n Impairment testing of assets, particularly of goodwill, involves estimating the future cash \n flows for a cash-generating unit and an appropriate discount rate, in order to determine \n an estimated recoverable value, as set out in note 14. \n \n The Group Consolidated Balance Sheet includes deferred tax assets of €85,465,000 \n (2011: €79,073,000) relating to deductible temporary differences, of which €37,814,000 \n (2011: €34,597,000) relate to tax loss carry-forwards expected to be utilisable, as set  \n out in note 24. The recoverable value is based on forecasts of the corresponding Group \n company’s taxable income over a period of several years. As actual results may differ \n from these forecasts, these deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted accordingly.\n \n The estimation of employee benefit costs requires the use of actuaries and the \n determination of appropriate assumptions such as the discount rate, average life \n expectancy, expected long term rates of return on plan assets and other assumptions,  \n as set out in note 25.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n 142\n \n Notes to the Group Consolidated Financial  \n Statements (continued)\n for the year ended 31 July 2012\n \n Significant subsidiaries\n \n 35 \n A list of all of the Group’s significant subsidiary undertakings as at 31 July 2012 and \n 2011 is provided in the table below.

This responsibility \n includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant \n to the preparation and fair presentation of the Group consolidated financial statements \n that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of \n Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies \n and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n \n Auditor’s Responsibility\n Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Group consolidated financial \n statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law \n and Swiss Auditing Standards as well as the International Standards on Auditing.  \n Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable \n assurance whether the Group consolidated financial statements are free from material \n misstatement.\n \n An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts \n and disclosures in the Group consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected \n depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material \n misstatement of the Group consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or  \n error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control  \n system relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the Group consolidated \n financial statements, in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the \n circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of \n the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness \n of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, \n as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Group consolidated financial \n statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \n appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Group Consolidated Financial

The Group has formal risk assessment processes \n in place through which risks and mitigating controls are evaluated. These processes  \n are driven by local management, who are best placed to identify the significant ongoing \n and emerging risks facing the business. The outputs of these risk assessment processes \n are subject to various levels of review by Group management and Internal Audit, and  \n a consolidated Risk Map denoting potential frequency, severity and velocity of identified \n risks is reviewed by the ARYZTA Board of Directors on an annual basis.

Executives are remunerated in line \n with the level of their authority and responsibility within the Group, with the various  \n elements of the remuneration package for Executive Management being reviewed annually \n by the NRC. \n \n The NRC reports to the Board at the next Board meeting following a meeting of the NRC. \n The CEO attends meetings of the NRC by invitation only.\n \n Executive Management basic salary and benefits\n The basic salary of Executive Management is reviewed annually by the NRC with regard \n to personal performance and corporate goals (as set out in Part 1 of the Compensation \n Report). When reviewing Executive Managements’ basic salary, the applicable weighting \n of each component is at the discretion of the NRC. Employment-related benefits consist \n principally of a car allowance and pension. Pension benefits are determined solely in relation \n to basic salary.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 153\n \n Notes to the Company Financial Statements \n (continued)\n \n Executive Management short-term performance related bonus\n For financial year 2012, the short-term performance related bonus for Executive \n Management was determined exclusively by reference to incremental gains in Food \n Group Underlying ROIC (as set out in Part 1 of the Compensation Report). \n \n In order to compare ROIC on a like-for-like basis, the Group calculates the Food Group \n Underlying ROIC, in addition to the reported ROIC. The measurement indicator is based \n on the assets of the Food Group business that existed as of 31 July 2011, using currency \n rates consistent with 2011, excluding net assets and historical EBITA levels of  \n acquisitions completed after 1 August 2011 and adding back asset impairments (unless \n recovered once the assets are disposed). Based on these adjustments, the Food Group \n Underlying ROIC for the financial year 2012 was 11.3%, compared with the Food Group \n 2011 ROIC of 10.2%.\n \n Subject to a minimum incremental increase in Underlying ROIC of 50bps being achieved \n during the year, Executive Management and other senior executives throughout the \n Group receive a percentage of their set target bonus based on the corresponding gain in \n Food Group Underlying ROIC. The short-term performance-related bonus for executive \n management is capped at 100% of basic salary.\n \n Executive Management long-term incentives (LTIP)\n As set out in the Compensation Report on pages 48 to 55 this report, the long-term \n incentive remuneration of Executive Management consists of both Matching Plan and \n Option Equivalent Plan awards. \n \n Participants with Matching Plan awards have the prospect of receiving a multiple  \n (ranging from one to three times) of the number of Qualifying Investment Shares held \n for the purposes of the Matching Plan. This multiple is determined on a fractional pro-\n rata basis ranging from one to three, based on EPS growth between 10.0% and 15.0%. \n In the event of the minimum 10% growth target not being achieved, no awards vest. \n The  satisfaction of additional criteria is also required, including compliance with the \n  condition that Food Group ROIC must have exceeded the Food Group WACC throughout the \n  performance period and the additional condition regarding maintenance of the ARYZTA \n dividend policy. \n \n Vesting of awards under the Option Equivalent Plan is conditional on compound annual \n growth in underlying fully diluted EPS in three consecutive accounting periods exceeding \n the growth in the eurozone Core Consumer Price Index, plus 5%, on an annualised basis. \n The satisfaction of additional criteria is also required including compliance with the \n condition that Food Group ROIC must have exceeded the Food Group WACC throughout \n the performance period and the additional condition regarding maintenance of the \n ARYZTA dividend policy.\n \n See note 8 of the Group Financial Statements (page 95) for the total cost recognised in \n the Group Financial Statements for share-based payments in the financial year 2012.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 154\n \n Notes to the Company Financial Statements \n (continued)\n \n Compensation to members of the Board of Directors\n Executive and non-executive board members are paid a yearly fee (CHF 88,000), which \n reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of the role. Additional compensation is \n payable for service on a Board Committee (CHF 8,000) and for the Chair thereof \n (CHF 16,000). The NRC determines, at its discretion, the level of these yearly fees and \n additional compensation paid to each executive and non-executive Board member.

This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an \n internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are  \n free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors  \n is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and \n making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n \n Auditor’s Responsibility\n Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our  \n audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing  Standards. \n Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable \n  assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. \n \n An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts \n and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the  \n auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the \n financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, \n the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of \n the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the \n circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of \n the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness \n of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made,  \n as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the  \n audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our \n audit opinion.\n \n Opinion\n In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2012 comply with \n Swiss law as well as with the Company’s Articles of Association.\n \n \fARYZTA AG  Accounts 2012\n \n Company Financial Statements\n \n 159\n \n Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Financial \n Statements to the General Meeting of ARYZTA AG \n (continued)\n \n Report on Other Legal Requirements\n We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor \n Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that \n there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.\n \n In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard \n 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the \n preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of \n Directors.\n \n We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with \n Swiss law and the Company’s Articles of Association.
